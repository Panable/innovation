we are cleansed and made pure through the shed blood upon the tree, and (<NUM>) light - that jesus is the light of the world and the light on the tree is the light on our lives. he said we are the light of the world when we allow him to live in us. as time passed, all kinds of things have been added and the real purpose of the tree has been forgotten. one more very important thing that is added to a european tree is the manger. it is set up under the tree in the center with a place of prominence. usually, the christ child is not added until christmas morning. the tree in europe is left in place until january when the three wise men came from the east to worship the king and this is when gifts are usually exchanged. while i love the giving (and the getting!) and the gathering and the eating all the fun things that go with christmas as much as the next person and maybe more than some, i would like to encourage us all as we enter the season. if you have an artificial or real tree, a ""color theme"" or mix and match, as you set the tree, remember who died on a tree for you and your home. let it represent in your home his sacrifice on the bare tree. let's pray for the opportunity to witness in a different way to our unsaved friends and family. if you have a tree in your home this year, and you have unsaved family, as you decorate it, each time you admire it, pray ""father, let this tree represent you in this home. let your light shine through me. let me share your gifts you have given me with those you place in my path. as i wrap each present, i pray your anointing goes with that gift. let the sweater, the scarf, the article of clothes represent your covering over that loved one. let that toy bring joy to that child and open a way for me to minister in a fresh way to that young heart. each time the keyboard on that computer is touched, as i touch it, lord, i know your spirit linger there as it did for elijah on that bed and the child was raised. i want your resurrection power to flow through me to each person you have given me to care for. as i hang ornaments on the tree, let each one represent a habit, a fear, a concern, a pain, a past unforgiven, a sickness, a financial burden, a child, a husband, a wife, a future unknown and uncertain, and the act of hanging be an act of faith of hanging it on the cross. an act of placing that care in your capable hands. as the lights are strung on the tree and home, let your light shine through me. let my home be a beacon of your love in a dark, hurting, crying, sighing, dying world. as i meet with friends and family and reach out to hug, let my arms be your arms reaching out in love. use me, mold me, make me what i ought to be so i can be more like you. in jesus' name...amen!"" just a thought i wanted to share. we have a chance to make a real difference in our homes as we allow jesus to make a difference in our hearts. i love you all....carol word",kaggle_enron_emails,0.0,0.0,6457,1166,1.0,0.0958649527644417,0.644107170512622,0.0,0.07882917763667338,0.07960353105157193,2,0,125,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.38078902229845624,60,19.114754098360656

not_spam,this article from url has been sent to you by khare url texas pacific in addition to its multibillion dollar portfolio detailed below actually does invest in promising new companies not just turnarounds it s just that knownow is waaay to small of a part of their NUMBER b portfolio so far rohit khare url texas pacific goes where others fear to spend august NUMBER by riva d atlas and edward wong it was one of the first calls david n siegel placed when he became chief executive of the beleaguered us airways last march seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner and meaner business plan keep his planes flying and renegotiate costly contracts with the unions he flipped through his files and found the number for the texas pacific group an investment firm headed by david bonderman a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation for fixing problem companies mr siegel once a top executive at continental airlines had watched texas pacific s partners turn an investment of number million in the airline made three years after it filed for bankruptcy in number into a profit of more than number million and they had made nearly as much on their stake in america west which filed for bankruptcy in number that search for advice turned into an offer why not let texas pacific have a role in us airways revival asked richard schifter the texas pacific executive whom mr siegel reached in june mr siegel called mr schifter again and days before us airways announced its plans to file for bankruptcy two weeks ago but after it had negotiated about number million in concessions with its unions texas pacific based in fort worth and san francisco agreed to kick in number million as part of a number million loan to keep the company operating during bankruptcy it also agreed to buy number million of stock or number percent of the company and take number of number seats on the board if us airways emerges from bankruptcy unless another investor surfaces with a better offer one of the reasons we were interested is few other folks were said james coulter a partner at texas pacific in an interview after the bankruptcy filing there aren t many people around with the stomach or the knowledge to delve into the airline industry texas pacific which manages number billion thrives by buying businesses no one else wants mr coulter and mr bonderman made their names during the recession of the early number s with investments in continental and america west the firm s hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping companies sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its extensive network of contacts for talented replacements now the partners are again looking for trouble in the last year alone texas pacific has announced or completed six acquisitions most in unloved industries like semiconductors reinsurance and airlines just last month it announced plans to buy burger king which has been losing market share for NUMBER billion it is also bidding for bankgesellschaft berlin a large and troubled bank the most creative and potentially lucrative of these deals could be texas pacific s acquisition last november of memc electronic materials a semiconductor company for number yes just number in cash it will also guarantee a number million bank loan in the last few years most firms that specialize in leveraged buyouts the use of junk bonds bank loans and other borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies have been largely inactive falling stock prices have made managements reluctant to sell cheaply companies that are for sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze texas pacific is different this is a terrific environment for them said stephen schwarzman chief executive of the blackstone group which also specializes in buyouts mark attanasio a managing director at trust company of the west which has invested with texas pacific said most other buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing you don t see many guys wanting to take on operational fixes like most other buyout firms texas pacific tries to keep its inner workings private its partners rarely grant interviews and its web site is perpetually under construction mr bonderman mr coulter and william price the third founding partner declined to be interviewed for this article mr bonderman number is known for his rumpled shirts and bright patterned socks he likes argyle socks and they tend to fall down around his ankles said henry miller an investment banker who advises troubled companies early in his career when he was a washington lawyer mr bonderman argued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit when a texas pacific deal is being negotiated he is known for obsessively staying in touch even when he is trekking in places like pakistan nepal and most recently bhutan whenever i see a long unfamiliar phone number pop up on my caller i d i know it s david calling said one investment banker who often works with mr bonderman mr bonderman made his reputation in the number s as the chief investment officer for robert bass the texas oilman mr bonderman enriched mr bass a second time by making early bets in industries like cable television and taking stakes in troubled companies like american savings loan which had been seized by the government over nearly a decade mr bonderman s picks earned an average annual return of number percent for mr bass in number mr bonderman struck out on his own with mr coulter a former lehman brothers banker who had also worked for mr bass they teamed up later that year with mr price a veteran of ge capital capital and bain company a consulting firm to form texas pacific the three men have complementary skills investment bankers and other deal makers said mr bonderman is the master strategist and mr coulter is good at structuring deals and the detailed management of the firm s purchases mr price often recruits managers and advises on operational issues david is very much the optimist very much the deal maker said greg brenneman a former president of continental jim is very much a counterbalance to david he will sit back and ask the tough questions he will approach investments a little bit more skeptically than david does by the end of the number s texas pacific was well established in deal making it easily raised NUMBER billion from pension funds and other investors in early number to celebrate their war chest the firm s partners rented san francisco s city hall and hired the b number s to play at a party but as the stock market began to tumble texas pacific hesitated for a number month stretch the partners made no deals they checked out some of the biggest corporate blowups including adelphia xerox and global crossing but stayed away finding the prices and the quality of the businesses untenable instead texas pacific began to hastily exit some existing investments taking more than number billion in profits during that stretch they started to cash out early in the cycle said mario giannini chief executive of hamilton lane a money management firm some of whose clients are texas pacific investors the good times of the late number s were not ideal for texas pacific it struggled to find downtrodden companies that needed its help but texas pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the rough it revived oxford health plans the health maintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the mid number s almost doubling its money after bringing in new managers and upgrading computer systems in number it made a number million investment in ducati motor the italian motorcycle maker whose profits have since more than quadrupled but texas pacific also stumbled usually when it bought at the top of the market texas pacific s number million investment in the j crew group the clothing retailer for which it paid a steep price of number times cash flow in number has been a disappointment so has its number purchase of bally the shoe maker which has suffered from lower demand for luxury goods texas pacific also lost more than number million on zilog a semiconductor company and favorite brands a candy maker both of which filed for bankruptcy some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm s performance texas pacific is still selling off holdings in two investment funds it raised over the last decade the first fund a number million portfolio raised in number and including investments made through march number should return more than number percent according to one texas pacific investor but its second fund NUMBER billion raised in number could return less than half that this investor estimated since the firm had less time to take profits on these investments before the stock market sank but because texas pacific has not sold many of its holdings in the second fund profits on these investments could rebound it is hoping for example that with new management in place j crew will turn around as the economy rebounds in any case one competitor said their returns look pretty good when you consider that some other funds won t return any capital to investors but with the weak economy throwing many companies into trouble texas pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier success the investor said they should do exceptionally well he said texas pacific has a distinct style if not formula it relies on talented self sufficient managers to restructure troubled companies preferring to remain hands off except for surveillance from the boardroom when necessary it replaces managers less than a year after continental emerged from bankruptcy for example mr bonderman watched with frustration as his old friend robert r ferguson the chief executive led it to the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court continental s board where mr bonderman was chairman then brought in gordon m bethune an executive at boeing and in october number he replaced mr ferguson as chief executive mr bethune quickly did a top to bottom overhaul of the company and is now considered a great turnaround artist of the industry the biggest conflict i ve ever seen was with bob ferguson said clark onstad a former general counsel for the federal aviation administration in describing the thinking of mr bonderman whom he has known since the number braniff bankruptcy he chose bethune over his longtime friend ferguson because he thought bethune would do a better job at america west texas pacific initiated an even more extensive management overhaul this time the charge was led by mr coulter and mr schifter both directors w douglas parker the current chief executive flew to mr coulter s home in san francisco to interview for the job of chief financial officer they talked for hours and mr parker said the two men quickly realized they had somewhat kindred spirits the board replaced most senior managers at america west except william franke the chief executive who stepped down last september his restructuring plan had made the airline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from bankruptcy in august number texas pacific owns just number percent of america west worth about NUMBER million but those are controlling shares and the group holds more than number percent of the votes these are not passive investors nor am i said donald l sturm a denver businessman who serves on continental s board with mr bonderman and mr price you re active your money is at stake your reputation is at stake after overseeing managers who worked successfully with unions at continental and america west texas pacific has a good reputation with labor that was one reason us airways was interested in a texas pacific investment said chris chiames a spokesman for the airline mr siegel wanted an investor who would be as labor friendly as possible mr chiames said but us airways can still entertain other bids this fall and marvin davis the billionaire investor from los angeles has expressed interest texas pacific s investment in burger king made with goldman sachs and bain capital was announced after two years of discussions among texas pacific s partners and the chain s franchisees even before the company which had been owned by diageo the liquor company was put up for sale said julian josephson chairman of the national franchisee association which represents most burger king franchisees we liked what they had to say about the human component of the businesses they buy mr josephson said many other owners he added are dismissive of labor at burger king texas pacific will also be working with an executive it knows burger king s chief executive is john dasburg the former chief executive of northwest airlines who met mr bonderman and his partners when northwest bought out their stake in continental in number unlike most buyout firms texas pacific remains enamored with the technology industry despite the failure of so many start ups the last two years it has focused on the semiconductor industry which like the airline industry is highly cyclical so far though results have been mixed the firm s number acquisition of the paradyne corporation which makes equipment for high speed internet connections has been a huge success texas pacific split it in two and took both parts public in the late number s selling most of its stakes for number times its investment but a much larger investment its number million acquisition of zilog the chip maker in number was made just before the economic crisis in asia caused chip prices to plummet zilog filed for bankruptcy last year texas pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third company on semiconductor which it acquired for NUMBER billion three years ago it invested number million more last year its latest gamble on the industry the number deal for memc may prove the most lucrative the cost of mailing the payment to e on based in d sseldorf germany was actually more than the acquisition one executive close to the deal said texas pacific and its partners in the deal trust company of the west and leonard green partners agreed to guarantee a number million revolving line of credit texas pacific also assumed number million worth of debt most of which it swapped for more stock in the company they did a good job of timing the acquisition said nabeel gareeb the company s chief executive who noted that in the last quarter memc reported its first profit since the fourth quarter of number but texas pacific s interest in airlines is clearly sizable besides its involvement in continental america west and us airways the company plans to buy gate gourmet the catering business of the bankrupt swissair group two years ago texas pacific started a web based discount ticket service called hotwire it put up most of the number million in seed money then persuaded six airlines to invest with it said karl peterson the chief executive hotwire instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets as priceline does shows the cheapest ticket on its web site but does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until after the sale the contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt hotwire which is privately owned mr peterson said that the company was still unprofitable but that texas pacific remains committed to it last spring mr peterson met mr bonderman in aspen to talk about hotwire and to go snowboarding mr bonderman seemed perfectly willing to accompany hotwire down the steep internet chute but he does have his limits on risk mr peterson discovered before going down the mountain mr bonderman strapped

not_spam,url url date not supplied i just finished reading an article about mozilla number for salon com number this excerpt was rather amusing _it is a good question because in almost every way mozilla is a better browser than navigator for example netscape s best new feature tabbed browsing which lets you have several web pages open in the same browser window and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name was in mozilla many months ago and the mozilla project that created it called multizilla already has an improved version available when asked about this yecies of netscape said that s true but the engineer who s working on it for mozilla is a netscape employee it was always done with the intention of fostering general browsing usability for netscape _ yes ok i suppose that s true if by netscape employee you really meant apple employee and by always done with the intention of fostering general browsing usability for netscape you meant was done in a weekend for mozilla because i thought multizilla was cool here s how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened one night i finally downloaded an extension called multizilla go check it out on mozdev org number i was particularly impressed with a feature contained in multizilla called tabbed browsing i started doing research and discovered netcaptor number a tabbed browser that embedded winie multizilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that prevented the code from being incorporated into the mozilla tree the first was a ui flaw namely that at the time it had ripped off netcaptor down to the last context menu item the gui was similar enough that there would have been definite concerns about so obviously copying some of netcaptor s more obscure capabilities like sticky names and tab locking the second concern was that the tab behavior wasn t encapsulated cleanly into a widget i produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time did it in a weekend that removed some of the geekier netcaptor features and that encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other navigator files would be minimal once i established that it didn t degrade performance in the single tab case i checked it in as an experiment the response was overwhelming as were the bugs that started being filed so much so that at first i wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree i was overruled by mozilla which turned out to be a good thing for all i think even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed browsing on the engineering side and in the mozilla community netscape still didn t get it netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document they continued to do so for months simply not getting it it was this odd curiosity that one of their engineers had checked in and they didn t know what to make of it only after the press raved about it did netscape really jump on board i m sure netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking can t you just see it now we ll have a popup manager and a manager to manage the popup manager and twenty seven preferences for fine grained control of all aspects of popups can you believe how disfunctional netscape is when their engineers say you should do this or you should do that they get completely ignored or blown off but when cnet says we didn t like this or we didn t like that netscape scurries to meet their demands that is simply pathetic number url number url number url number url,kaggle_spam_emails,0.0,0.0,3550,632,1.0,0.0,0.8216901408450704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.4541139240506329,0,632.0

or- should i see interest income from this $<NUM> million quebecor promotional fee in the breakout of the sap account# <NUM> interest income- third party? this error was corrected in <NUM>. <NUM>. the next issue is book amortization. where is this being recorded on the income statement?-is it still in <NUM>? there seems to have been confusion about if this was going to change. this is still recorded in account <NUM> - other cos. we had tried to move it to amortization expense, but wade wanted it moved back above the line in cos. this makes sense as really this amortization is a cost to the deal. here's a schedule that details out the amortization activity for <NUM>: i have the following listed as companies that have separate amortization issues: browns giants owens corning advanced glass owens canada extended promo license (extension of owens corning) quebecor giants equipment i already have received completed book amortization schedules for the first three from you (provided to angie last year)- can you provide the amortization schedules for the rest? it is my understanding that on the last <NUM>- no book amortization was recorded in <NUM>- and that the amount that should have been recorded in <NUM> will be caught up along with the booking of the <NUM> NUMBER s. can you please verify that this is true and that the recording of the <NUM> has occured? also- could you please provide information for any other new deals that have occured in <NUM> that books is calculating amortization for? i am open to any suggestions that would make this easier to track. <NUM>. the next major issue is deferred debits. can a get a detail of what makes up deferred debits as of <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM>? here's a breakout of deferred debits at <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM>. one thing i know will change is the owen's canada promotional payment should actually be charged against the owen's corning deal. this will be changed in july. <NUM>. can i also have a detailed breakdown of what is making up sap acct# <NUM> other revenues third party? while i was reviewing this account for <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM>, i found quite a few errors in the account, so i corrected these in july. i think it would be easier for me to send you a schedule as of <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> with the breakdown of this account. i am working on this schedule this week and will forward it to you by friday. would it be possible to get all of this information by the end of the month? please call me if you want to discuss- or if it would be easier to just meet in person. thanks- shanna i found a few more accounts that i need detail for that explains the balances as of <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM>: <NUM>. <NUM> deferred asset development cost - the eschedule should help you with this. basically this account was all of our ""deferred debit"" activity that was moved from the msa system. this month (august) we are actually going to move all construction costs to this account and leave all other ""deferred debit"" activity in <NUM>. see the above reconciliation - this details both accounts. <NUM>. <NUM> deferred revenue/gains - this is where we record remedial/replacement capital. currently we have replacement capital for springs, simon, & tyco. let me know if you need further explanation on replacement capital. <NUM>. <NUM> deferred credits- other (there is only one entry in this account and sap says it was made by you) this is a deferred liability relating to the pilkington contract. we have agreed to pay them <NUM>.5mm through credits on their next <NUM> invoices. this was expensed in june and this liability was established. the credits on the invoice will be debited against this liability. <NUM>. <NUM> current liabilities- other the balance is in this account represents our cost accruals for june. <NUM>. <NUM> other revenues- third party - see above (if this is in e-schedule form- that is great. unfortunately, i currently don't have access to the folder on the j drive where ees posts the e-schedules. i am trying to get access.) i have attached the eschedule:",kaggle_enron_emails,0.0,0.0,6276,1052,1.0,0.036488209050350544,0.7264181007010835,0.0007966857871255577,0.04238368387507967,0.06883365200764818,0,10,74,4,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0.3849809885931559,65,15.93939393939394

not_spam,i have some patches that seem to fix avoid this problem now it is amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails long enough for ups s to run out and all that is left operational is the laptop and its battery supply first i put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was occurring so that if exmh is attempting for any reason to expand a sequence that isn t either a number or a range of NUMBER s or a list of such things it will simply ignore the trash rather than giving a traceback this one solves the initial problem mh tcl was thu aug NUMBER NUMBER number mh tcl wed aug NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER number set seq set rseq foreach range split string trim sequence if regexp NUMBER NUMBER range just ignore anything bogus continue set parts split string trim range if llength parts number lappend seq parts that is amending proc mhseqexpand which is where the error was occurring before the code assumes that range is either nnn or nnn mmm so we should probably make sure that s true issue an error instead of just continue if you like but i don t think an error is needed but that just allowed me to create a similar problem in another place by typing nnn and rather than continue to fight fires like this i thought i should think more about brent s suggestion but rather than have the selection code actually validate the input which would mean it would have to know what is to be valid i decided that the right thing to do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input so i just stuck a catch around the msgshow that is processing the nonsense that the user has typed this way any later expansion to what msgshow treats as legal maybe allowing a sequence name like prev or next or anything else can be handled just there without someone needing to remember that they have to go fix the selection processing code to allow it but while i was playing there i noticed something i never new before if you type number the number changes to number and so on for each that is typed i suspect that s perhaps an artifact of is bound to a different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the current and the target folder but it has to mean something if the current input mode is a message number so let it mean but now i found it i think its nice but if we can type number why not number as well that kind of limitation bugs me so i fixed it and then i wondered about folders with names containing the special use of as the toggle character means there s no way to type those from the keyboard so i fixed that as well this makes two different restrictions there s no way to type a folder name that has a name beginning with but such a thing in mh would be a pain to use anyway so i doubt this will bother anyone and it is now only possible to toggle between typing the current target folder name when the name being typed is empty i m less happy about that part but i think i can live with it in order to allow folder names with s in them to exist and be typed then since i was there anyway i decided to do something about another feature that has always bugged me in normal keyboard mode s is the key used to show a message but if you ve just typed number and the ftoc is highlighting number as the current message and you want to now show that message you can t type s you have to type r instead so i fixed this one as well fixed here is in quotes as it assumes that the keybinding for msgshow is s if you change that to something else it will remain s in here i don t know enough tk tcl to have it discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order to bind the same one here r continues to work of course and now i got started in fixing irritants in this code i also made it clear the status line if you abort message folder entry mode c or g previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next message appeared which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had reverted to its usual bindings in any case what follows is the patch that does all of that i believe that if you apply this then the one above is probably not needed the catch around the msgshow will hide the problem i don t think we really need to fix brent s way of invoking it or include it anyway just for completeness i haven t run an exmh with the following patch but not the previous one so i don t know for sure

(sanm: news, msgs), a maker of electronic components for equipment makers, and tyco (tyc: news, msgs), a diversified electronics and industrial company. sanmina makes electronic components and cables for equipment manufacturers in the communications, industrial, medical and high-speed computer markets. last week, merrill lynch chose sanmina as one of top <NUM> tech stocks that are expected to outperform in the next six to <NUM> months. in the fourth quarter, sanmina's earnings before one-time charges more than doubled from the like period in <NUM>, beating wall street's consensus estimate by <NUM> cents. revenue almost doubled to $<NUM>.<NUM> billion. company profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings. tyco sells to the telecommunications, electronics, health-care, industrial goods and fire and security services markets. tyco recently completed the acquisition of mallinckrodt, a specialty medical products maker, boosting its position in the respiratory care arena. fourth-quarter earnings before extraordinary items rose by <NUM> percent to $<NUM>.<NUM> billion, or <NUM> cents a share, from a year ago. sales went up by <NUM> percent to $<NUM>.<NUM> billion. company profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings. earlier this month, legg mason raised its rating on tyco to ""buy"" from ""market performance."" elizabeth mackay, chief investment strategist at bear stearns, includes tyco on her recommended list. mortgage lenders a gore presidency could end an action by some lawmakers to sever these lenders' lines of credit from the u.s. treasury, said erik gustafson, senior portfolio manager for liberty growth stock fund. the argument for severance is that these congressionally chartered lenders have an unfair advantage over other banking and mortgage lenders. in addition, the sec's new fair disclosure regulation can be expected to boost companies with reliable earnings growth, according to bear stearns. stocks expected to do well in this environment include fannie mae (fnm: news, msgs) and freddie mac (fre: news, msgs), bear stearns said. fannie mae, or the federal national mortgage association, and freddie mac, the federal home loan mortgage corp., buy conventional home mortgages from banks and mortgage bankers and sells them as securities. fannie mae: company profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings. freddie mac: company profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings. health care providers an increase in government spending on medicare should boost stocks in this sector. warren isabelle, president of ironwood capital management, likes nursing home operator beverly enterprises (bev: news, msgs). last week, ing barings raised its rating on beverly enterprises to ""buy"" from ""hold."" beverly enterprises recently reported a second-quarter profit, reversing a loss from <NUM>. the company's business is improving because of increased revenue from medicare and medicaid. however, beverly has taken a hit lately because it's adding $<NUM> million to its reserves for patient liability costs for <NUM>. alternative energy sources in his book, ""earth in the balance,"" gore called for the gradual elimination of the internal combustion engine and espoused other environmental beliefs. as such, alternative energy stocks should do well under his presidency, specifically fuel cell companies, said jim lowell, chief portfolio strategist for adviser investments management. one stock he likes is fuelcell energy (fcel: news, msgs). fuelcell develops electrochemical technologies that generate electricity without combustion. last week, friedman billings ramsey raised its rating on fuelcell to ""accumulate,"" following chase h&q's upgrade to ""buy"" earlier in the month. fuelcell also has allied with enron (ene: news, msgs) to develop and sell fuelcell's direct fuelcel products. enron has invested $<NUM> million in the company. company profile, latest financials, analysts' ratings. what about tech stocks? here, analysts have mixed feelings. kaufman believes both candidates would be good for the sector in general, but gustafson disagrees, citing the worsening of the regulatory environment in the last eight years and the antitrust action against microsoft (msft: news, msgs). lowell thinks gore's impact would be neutral to negative, but analyst safa rashtchy of us bancorp piper jaffray said the democrat could be good for net stocks. gore vs. bush portfolios thus far, gore is ahead of bush, based on a basket of stocks pegged to each candidate's possible presidency. since sept. <NUM>, lisa kammert, an analyst at birinyi associates, has been tracking two portfolios comprising <NUM> stocks each that would do well under gore or bush. as of monday, gore's portfolio has outperformed bush's by <NUM>.<NUM> percent, based on a simple average of each stock's return. in <NUM>, the same model accurately predicted a clinton win. in the gore portfolio are amazon.com, yahoo, citigroup, bank of america, disney, time warner, bellsouth, duke energy, tenet healthcare, procter & gamble, coca-cola and waste management. in bush's basket are ibm, microsoft, exxon mobil, transocean sedco, merrill lynch, bristol myers, w.r. grace, beazer homes, philip morris and boeing. going into the last week before the election, gore has outpaced bush most of the time since sept. <NUM>. as for job growth, a study by executive recruiter challenger, gray & christmas indicates that a gore administration would boost employment for the mass transit sector, education, health care, construction (homes and schools), agriculture, lawyers, insurance, law enforcement, commercial banking and forestry.?",kaggle_enron_emails,0.0,0.0,7692,1145,1.0,0.014170566822672906,0.7870514820592823,0.0,0.04563182527301092,0.0500520020800832,0,3,35,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0.5624454148471616,84,13.470588235294118

competing solutions that process xml data in software datapower s device processes the data in hardware a technology achievement that provides greater performance according to company officials the new device dubbed datapower xa NUMBER xml accelerator is the first in a family of products expected from the cambridge mass based startup the datapower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called xg NUMBER that does the analysis parsing and processing of the xml data according to steve kelly ceo of datapower the xa NUMBER accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption

an inline device is the best alternative in addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount importance in the world of xml today s firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only kelly said a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall firewalls are blind to xml today future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on security especially as web services proliferate kelly said according to datapower most existing solutions to offload xml processing are homegrown and done in software an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security after trying the software path the company turned to creating a solution that would process xml in hardware our xg NUMBER execution core converts xml to machine code said kelly adding that to his knowledge no other company s solution does kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do xml processing claims that he believes will be mostly false other content aware switches such as ssl secure socket layer accelerators and load balancers look at the first number bytes of a packet while the xa NUMBER provides deeper packet inspection looking at NUMBER bytes and thus enabling greater processing of xml data kelly explained the NUMBER u high network device has been tested against a large collection of xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device the xa NUMBER can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are xml kelly said in addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an application co processor this deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device datapower is not the only company chasing

not_spam,"(pst) from: <EMAIL> to: <EMAIL> cc: <EMAIL>, <EMAIL> bcc: <EMAIL>, <EMAIL> my several hours of on-line research on this last sept. turned up nothing on point. the only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of contracts in a certificate context was one i'll excerpt here: ** in maritimes & northeast pipeline, l.l.c., <NUM> ferc p <NUM>,<NUM> (<NUM>), maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it submitted. commission staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential. maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off dates [fn29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such information was commercially sensitive. on the other hand, maritimes requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of <NUM> and <NUM> years public. generally, the commission will deny blanket requests for confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market support for new facilities. [fn30] however, in the instance case, the contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and, thus, evidence of longterm subscriptions for maritimes proposal are in the public record and support our finding that maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed services. therefore, we find no compelling reason to require the length of the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut-off dates to be made public. fn29 cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could terminate contingent on the occurrence of certain events. fn30 see, e.g., colorado interstate gas company, <NUM> ferc p <NUM>,<NUM> (<NUM>). ** in amoco production company and amoco energy trading company v. natural gas pipeline company of america, <NUM> ferc p <NUM>,<NUM> (<NUM>), which involved a request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement, the commission explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment but transportation contracts should not: the commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a different footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are subject to similar disclosure requirements. in anr pipeline co., the commission explained that unlike gas sales in a competitive market, transportation of natural gas is still regulated under the assumption that the pipeline exercises market power. even where transportation competition exists, that competition is from other pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting requirements. there were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the context of section <NUM> cases. just to make sure i found everything, i'll do some follow up sometime in the next few days and let you know if i find anything. from: drew fossum <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> <NUM>:<NUM> am to: susan scott/et&s/enron@enron cc: steven harris/et&s/enron@enron, kevin hyatt/et&s/enron@enron, lorraine lindberg/et&s/enron@enron, donna martens/et&s/enron@enron, mary kay miller/et&s/enron@enron, keith petersen/et&s/enron@enron, <EMAIL>, <EMAIL> susan's draft has inspired me to vent months worth of frustration at the commission. to save susan from trying to translate my weird scribbles, i'm having martha type up my vitriol. please hold off on detailed comments on susan's draft unless you've already finished them. i'll circulate a revised draft to you all later today. in the mean time, susan and frank and steve, are there not some cases in which the commission has specifically granted confidential treatment of precedent agreements or discount agreements in expansion cases. i know the bulk of authority is against us, but i seem to recall at least a few stray decisions where the commission granted confid. treatment (even if only for a limited time). lets talk. thanks. df from: susan scott <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> <NUM>:<NUM> pm to: drew fossum@enron, steven harris/et&s/enron@enron, kevin hyatt/et&s/enron@enron, lorraine lindberg/et&s/enron@enron, donna martens/et&s/enron@enron, mary kay miller/et&s/enron@enron, keith petersen/et&s/enron@enron cc: <EMAIL>, <EMAIL> here is the attachment... ---------------------- forwarded by susan scott/et&s/enron on <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> <NUM>:<NUM> pm --------------------------- from: susan scott <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> <NUM>:<NUM> pm to: drew fossum@enron, steven harris/et&s/enron@enron, kevin hyatt/et&s/enron@enron, lorraine lindberg/et&s/enron@enron, donna martens/et&s/enron@enron, mary kay miller/et&s/enron@enron, keith petersen/et&s/enron@enron cc: <EMAIL>, <EMAIL> attached is my draft of a request for rehearing. it incorporates mr. stojic's and mr. kelly's initial comments. please review it and let me know if you have any comments on or before tuesday afternoon (i will be out of the office monday). thank you!",kaggle_enron_emails,0.0,0.0,4935,700,1.0,0.03343465045592705,0.7469098277608915,0.0016210739614994933,0.053495440729483285,0.07639311043566363,1,0,47,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.48857142857142855,39,17.5

not_spam,i can t believe i actually read a laugh out loud funny profile of the fcc commissioner fer crissakes so the following article comes recommended a fine explanation of michael powell s extraordinary equivocation on the other hand i can also agree with werbach s werblog entry rohit a trip to f c c world nicholas lemann has a piece in the new yorker this week about fcc chairman michael powell it s one of the first articles i ve seen that captures some of powell s real personality and the way he s viewed in washington unfortunately lemann ends by endorsing conventional political wisdom after describing how powell isn t really a fire breathing ideological conservative he concludes that in essence powell favors the inumbent local bell telephone companies while a democratic fcc would favor new entrants i know that s not how powell sees the world and though i disagree with him on many issues i think he s right to resist the old dichotomy the telecom collapse should be a humbling experience for anyone who went through it the disaster wasn t the regulators fault as some conservatives argue but something clearly went horribly wrong and policy makers should learn from that experience contrary to lemann s speculation the upstart carriers won t be successful in a gore administration because it s too late virtually all of them are dead and wall street has turned off the capital tap for the foreseeable future some may survive but as small players rather than world dominators the battle between clecs and rbocs that lemann so astutely parodies is old news the next important battle in telecom will be between those who want to stay within the traditional boxes and those who use different models entirely that s why open broadband networks and open spectrum are so important whatever the regulatory environment there is going to be consolidation in telecom those left out in that consolidation will face increasing pressure to create new pipes into the home or slowly die the victors in the consolidation game will cut back on innovation and raise prices which will create further pressure for alternatives lemann is right that policy making looks much drier and more ambiguous on the ground than through the lens of history but he s wrong in thinking that telecom s future will be something like its past friday october NUMBER NUMBER number am comments number url the chairman by nicholas lemann he s the other powell and no one is sure what he s up to new yorker october NUMBER last year my middle son in eighth grade and encountering his first fairly serious american history course indignantly reported that the whole subject was incomprehensible i was shocked what about gettysburg and the declaration of independence and the selma to montgomery march just look at my textbook he said and when i did i saw his point his class had got up to the eighteen forties what i expected was a big beefing up of the roles of sacagawea and crispus attucks and in deed there was some of that but the main difference between my son s text and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in american history there were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and reciprocal trade agreements i skipped ahead past the civil war hoping for easier going only to encounter currency floats and the regulation of freight rates only a few decades into the twentieth century did it become possible to see the federal government s main function as responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic interests even now if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in washington what you d find is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage not so much over the public as over each other agribusiness versus real estate banks versus insurance companies and so on the arena in which this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them it s an insider s game less because the players are secretive than because the public and the press encouraged by the players who speak in jargon can t get themselves interested one corner of washington might be called f c c world for the federal communications commission f c c world has perhaps five thousand denizens they work at the commission itself at the house and senate commerce committees and at the washington offices of the companies that the commission regulates they read communications daily subscription price NUMBER a year and every year around christmastime they grumblingly attend the chairman s dinner at a washington hotel where the high point of the evening is a scripted supposedly self deprecating comedy routine by the commission s chairman of all the federal agencies and commissions the f c c is the one that americans ought to be most interested in after all it is involved with a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the american economy as well as important aspects of daily life telephone and television and radio and newspapers and the internet and right now f c c world is in if not a crisis at least a very soapy lather because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the corporate scandals concerns the economic collapse of companies regulated by the f c c qwest worldcom adelphia and global crossing among others are or were part of f c c world aol time warner is part of f c c world jack grubman the former salomon smith barney analyst who seems to have succeeded kenneth lay of enron as the embodiment of the corporate scandals is part of f c c world in the past two years companies belonging to f c c world have lost trillions of dollars in stock market valuation and have collectively served as a dead weight pulling down the entire stock market this year an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state of the f c c has been circulating widely within f c c world it evokes f c c world s feverish mood the f c c is fiddling while rome burns and suggests why nobody besides residents of f c c world has thought of the commission in connection with the corporate scandals the sentence i just quoted is followed by this explanation the ilecs appear likely to enter all l d markets within twelve months while losing virtually no residential customers to attackers since number and suffering about number market share loss in business lines to clecs it s a lot easier to think about evil c e o s than to decipher that even in good times f c c world pays obsessive attention to the commission s chairman in bad times the attention becomes especially intense and when the chairman is a celebrity f c c world devotes itself to full time chairman watching the current chairman michael powell is a celebrity at least by government official standards because he is the only son of colin powell the secretary of state unlike his father he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity which generates enormous and at times apoplectically toned speculation about who he really is and what he s really up to powell is young to be the head of a federal agency he is thirty nine and genially charming everybody likes him before becoming chairman he was for three years one of the f c c s five commissioners not only is he fluent in the f c c s incomprehensible patois he has a clintonesque love of the arcane details of communications policy he s always saying that he s an avid moderate and yet he has a rage inciting quality one of his predecessors as chairman reed hundt quoted in forbes compared powell to herbert hoover mark cooper of the consumer federation of america calls him radical and extreme just as often as he s accused of being a right wing ideologue powell gets accused of being paralytically cautious it ain t about singing kum ba yah around the campfire another former chairman william kennard says you have to have an answer one day last spring powell testifying before a senate subcommittee delivered an anodyne opening statement and the subcommittee s chairman ernest hollings of south carolina berated him you don t care about these regulations hollings said you don t care about the law or what congress sets down that s the fundamental that s the misgiving i have of your administration over there it just is amazing to me you just pell mell down the road and seem to not care at all i think you d be a wonderful executive vice president of a chamber of commerce but not a chairman of a regulatory commission at the government level are you happy in your job extremely powell said with an amiable smile one cannot understand powell s maddening effect at least on democrats and liberal activists without understanding not just the stated purpose of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose the f c c was created by congress in number but it existed in prototype well before the new deal because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy cases for government intervention in the private economy making sure that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves its other original function was preventing american telephone telegraph the national monopoly phone company from treating its customers unfairly over the decades as f c c world grew up into a comfortable well established place the f c c segued into the role of industrial supervision its real purpose it was supposed to manage the competition among communications companies so that it didn t become too bloody by artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business in addition to looking out for the public s interest the commission more specifically protected the interests of members of congress many of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most terrifying category of interest group you can cross the local bank president and live to tell the tale but not the local broadcaster according to an oft told f c c world anecdote president clinton once blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers in the same city because he said if the so and so who owned the anti clinton little rock democrat gazette had owned the leading tv station in little rock too clinton would never have become president f c c world may have been con tentious but it was settled too because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic niches for themselves then in the nineteen eighties the successful breakup of a t t by far the biggest and most important company the commission regulated deposited a thick additional sediment of self confidence onto the consciousness of f c c world a generation ago for most americans there was one local phone company one long distance company and one company that manufactured telephones which customers were not permitted to own and they were all the same company it was illegal to plug any device into a phone line by the mid nineteen nineties there were a dozen economically viable local phone companies a handful of national long distance companies competing to offer customers the lowest price and best service and stores everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers and millions of americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the telephone lines a t t had argued for years that it was a natural monopoly requiring protection from economic competition and total control over its lines so much for that argument over the same period the f c c had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones and the internet it was the dream of federal agency success come true consumers vastly better served and the industry much bigger and more prosperous too the next big step was supposed to be the telecommunications act of number one of those massive endlessly lobbied over pieces of legislation which most people outside f c c world probably felt it was safe to ignore although the telecom act sailed under the rhetorical banner of modernization and deregulation its essence was a grand interest group bargain in which the local phone companies known to headline writers as baby bells and to f c c world as arbocks the pronounced version of rbocs or regional bell operating companies would be permitted to offer long distance service in exchange for letting the long distance companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for customers consumers would win because for the first time they would get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more competition than they already had in long distance but the politics and economics of the telecom act which was shepherded through congress by vice president gore were just as important democrats saw the act as helping to reposition them as the technology party the party that brought the internet into every home created hundreds of thousands of jobs in new companies and not least set off an investment boom whose beneficiaries might become the party s new contributor base clinton s slogans about the information superhighway and building a bridge to the twenty first century which like all clinton slogans artfully sent different messages to different constituencies were the rhetorical correlates of the telecom act and gore s cruise to the presidency was supposed to be powered substantially by the act s success the f c c had a crucial role in all this the arbocks are rich aggressive politically powerful and generally republican though like all important interest groups they work with both parties they immediately filed lawsuits which wound up tying the hands of their new competitors in the local phone market for more than three years through rule making enforcement and litigation the f c c then headed by reed hundt who was gore s classmate at st albans was supposed to keep the arbocks in their cages so that not only long distance companies like a t t and mci worldcom but also a whole category of new companies see lecks the pronounced version of clecs or competitive local exchange carriers could emerge this entailed the regulatory equivalent of hand to hand combat the see leck is supposed to have access to the arbock s switching equipment the arbock won t give the seeleck a key to the room where it s kept so the see leck asks the f c c to rule that the arbock has to give it the key partly because hundt assured the see lecks and other new companies that he would protect them and partly because of the generally booming condition of the economy then investment capital flooded into the see lecks companies with names like winstar covad and teligent and into other telecommunications companies even not obviously related technology companies like cisco systems benefitted from the telecom boom demand for their products was supposed to come from the see lecks and other new players there would be no conflict between the interests of the new telecom companies and those of consumers as one of hundt s former lieutenants told me reed used to joke that my job was to make sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up the years following the passage of the telecom act were the peak of the boom wall street had its blood up and that meant not just more startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies time warner and aol decided to throw in together and a t t and comcast and so on surely worldcom and the other telecom bad guys believed that their self dealing stock overselling and creative accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so undiscriminating by the time the outcome of the number presidential election had been determined the telecom crash was well under way nonetheless the chairmanship of the f c c remained one of the best jobs in terms of influence and visibility available to a career government regulator three republicans emerged as candidates powell who was a commissioner harold furchtgott roth the farthest to the right commissioner and patrick wood the head of the texas public utility commission and as such a george w bush guy in texas however wood had crossed the most powerful person in the arbock camp edward whitacre the c e o of s b c communications which is headquartered in san antonio this meant that the arbocks didn t want wood as head of the f c c because he might be too pro see leck wood is now the head of the federal energy regulatory commission michael powell had to signal the arbocks that he wasn t as threatening as wood while also signalling the conservative movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than furchtgott roth powell did this deftly for example in december of number he appeared before a conservative group called the progress freedom foundation and gave a very michael powell speech whimsical intellectual and free associative biblical history joseph schumpeter moore s law that began by making fun of the idea that the f c c should try to keep new telecom companies alive in the wake of the number act the f c c is often cast as the grinch who stole christmas powell said like the whos down in who ville who feast on who pudding and rare who roast beast the communications industry was preparing to feast on the deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the act s fertile soil but this feast the f c c grinch did not like in the least so it is thought thus powell was indicating that if he became chairman he didn t expect to administer first aid to the see lecks as part of the job he was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day of the bush administration twenty months into the administration nearly all the see lecks are dead or dying nearly all long distance companies not just worldcom are in serious trouble cable companies have lost half their value satellite companies are staggering the crash has had an automatically concentrating effect because as new companies die the existing companies market share increases and if the existing companies are in good shape financially they have the opportunity to pick up damaged companies at bargain prices during the bush administration as the financial carnage in communications has worsened the communications industry has moved in the direction of more concentration if the bells wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service and if they also merge the country will be on its way to having a national duopoly in local service verizon in the east and s b c in the west and these companies could dominate long distance as well because of the poor health of the long distance companies the cable business also seems close to having two dominant national companies aol time warner and comcast unlike the phone companies they don t have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more fully control what material they allow to enter people s homes as part of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the number telecom act the limits on concentration in the radio industry were significantly loosened and in the past six years the number of radio station owners in the united states has been cut by twenty five per cent today a large portion of local and national radio news programming is supplied by a single company westwood one a subsidiary of viacom in this situation many democrats and liberals think the f c c should be hyperactive the superhero of government regulation springing to the rescue of both consumers and the communications industry it should try to breathe life into the see lecks and other new companies it should disallow mergers maintain ownership limits and otherwise restrain the forces of concentration it should use the government s money and muscle to get new technology especially fast internet connections into the homes of people who can t afford it at current market prices an analogy that a lot of people in f c c world make is between telecom and the middle east the clinton people blame the bloodshed on the bush people because they disengaged when they came into office and the bush people blame it on the clinton people because they raised too many expectations and stirred too many passions but michael powell s f c c has not been hyperactive powell has been conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the f c c and waiting for the federal courts and the congress to send him signals in mid september powell finally initiated a formal review of the f c c s limits on media concentration this doesn t mean he has been inactive rather he has been active in a way that further infuriates his critics in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and the provocative he muses about whether the fundamental premises of f c c world really make sense while giving the impression that he s having the time of his life as chairman at his first press conference when he was asked what he was going to do about the digital divide that is economic inequality in access to the internet he said you know i think there is a mercedes divide i d like to have one and i can t afford one at the national cable telecommunications association convention in chicago powell following a troupe of tumblers to the stage interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a somersault not long ago i went to see powell in his office at the f c c until number when the commission moved to a new building in southwest washington near the city s open air fish market f c c world was at the western edge of downtown where everybody would encounter everybody else at a few familiar restaurants and bars today the f c c building looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park even the chairman s suite though large is beige carpeted and fluorescent powell is a bulky man who wears gold rimmed glasses and walks with a pronounced limp the result of injuries he suffered in a jeep accident in germany in number when he was an army officer because of the accident he left the army and went to law school where he became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation particularly the idea that the government rather than trying to correct the flaws of the market before the fact prophylactically as he likes to say should wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust litigation to fix them he worked briefly at a corporate law firm and then became a protégé of joel klein the head of the antitrust division of the clinton justice department and the man who led the government s legal case against microsoft he was recently appointed chancellor of the new york public school system it testifies to powell s political skill that he is probably the only high official in the bush administration who not only served in the clinton administration but also maintains close ties to bush s nemesis senator john mccain of arizona one of the things about powell that annoy people is his enduring love of law school it s sort of like a law school study session over there one democratic former commissioner said as if to confirm the charge powell when i arrived introduced me to four law students summer interns at the commission whom he d invited to sit in i began by asking powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions of the f c c for example could private companies have apportioned the airwaves among themselves without the government being involved i think we ll never know powell said i don t think it s an automatically bad idea the way some people will argue land is probably the best analogue we don t seize all the land in the united states and say the government will issue licenses to use land if my neighbor puts a fence one foot onto my property line there s a whole body of law about what i can do about that including whether i can tear it down if a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company it s a similar proposition there are scholars who argue indeed the famous ronald coase treatise that won the nobel prize was about this that spectrum policy is lunacy the market could work this out in the kinds of ways that we re accustomed to talking to powell was fun unlike most high government officials he doesn t seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding he slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs he speaks in ironic air quotes he s like your libertarian friend in college who enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he sees as sentimental or illogical after a while i asked him whether he thought his predecessors excitement about the number telecommunications act had been excessive i would start with a caveat powell said look i can t fault those judgments in and of themselves given the time and what people thought they were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities but frankly i ve always been a little bit critical first of all anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn t come anywhere close to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it by the president on down about the kinds of things it s going to open up i mean i don t know what provisions are the information superhighway provisions or what provisions are so digitally oriented or some of the things that were a big part of the theatre of its introduction when one starts reading the details one searches often in vain for these provisions but nonetheless there was a rising dot com excitement and an internet excitement and people thought this was historic legislation and it certainly was but we were sucking helium out of balloons with the kinds of expectations that were being bandied around and this is before the economy or the market even gets in trouble it was a dramatically exaggerated expectation by the leadership of the commission by politicians by the market itself by companies themselves it was a gold rush and led to some very detrimental business decisions ones that government encouraged by its policies frankly everybody wanted to see NUMBER s go up on the board powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the telecom act i want to see ten competitors twenty competitors i want to see thirty per cent market share fifty per cent market share i want the bells to bleed then we ll know we ve succeeded now powell returned to being powell i think that expectation was astonishingly unrealistic in the short term they wanted to see it while they re there we were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking and the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking there s no question we went too soon too fast too many companies took on too much debt too fast before the market really had a product or a business model how could the telecom act have been handled better we could have chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective and were slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system powell said money chased what seemed like government promised opportunity the problem with that is there s a morning after and we re in it and the problem is there is no short fix for this problem this debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level in some ways for short term gain we paid a price in long term stability powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there had been a more reasonable level of investment no we wouldn t have every home in america with competitive choice yet but we don t anyway i don t think it s the remonopolization of telephone service i don t buy that the bells will prosper but did anybody believe they wouldn t the part of the story that didn t materialize was that people thought so would mci worldcom and sprint other local phone companies he added hadn t materialized as viable businesses either and they never might everybody s always saying the regulators did this and this and this but candidly the story s quite the opposite i think the regulators bent over backward for six years to give them a chance conditions don t get that good except once every thirty years and it didn t happen so whatever the reason we re looking at a worldcom that s teetering we re looking at a long distance business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base a t t is breaking itself up sprint has struggled could the f c c have done anything to make the long distance companies stronger at the f c c i think i ll just be blunt my political answer yes there s all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try to help but i can t find thirty billion dollars for worldcom somewhere i can t mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an s e c investigation were i king it would be wonderful but i don t have those kinds of levers i don t know whether anybody does at some point companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from dying powell couldn t have made it much clearer that he doesn t think it s his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash he has demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist gestures in august for example five months after disbanding the f c c s accounting safeguards division powell announced that he was appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the communications industry but that shows that powell is better at riding out the storm than say harvey pitt his counterpart at the securities and exchange commission and does not mean that he plans to try to shore up the telecom industry i asked powell if it would bother him if for most people only one company provided cable television and only one provided local phone service yes he said it concerns us that there s one of each of those things but let s not diminish the importance of there being one of each of those things that still is a nice suite of communications capabilities even if they aren t direct analogues of each other anyway powell said before long the phone companies will be able to provide video service over their lines and the cable companies will provide data service over their lines so there will be more choice so yeah we have this anxiety we have one of everything the question is does it stay that way the concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of information did not appear to trouble powell either he said that people confuse bigness which brings many benefits with concentration which distorts markets if this were just economics it s easy if you were to say to me mike just worry about economic concentration we know how to do that the econometrics of antitrust i can tell you when a market s too concentrated and prices are going to rise the problem is other dimensions like political ideological sometimes emotional take the question of if everybody s controlling what you see the assumption there is that somehow there ll be this viewpoint a monolithic viewpoint pushed on you by your media and you won t get diversity i think that s a possibility i don t think it s nearly the possibility that s ascribed to it sometimes powell explained sometimes when we see very pointed political or parochial programming it gets attacked as unfair i see some of the same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when rush limbaugh exists they love diversity but somehow we should run howard stern off the planet if it has a point of view then it becomes accused of bias and then we have policies like here his tone went from ironic to sarcastic the fairness doctrine which seems to me like the antithesis of what i thought those people cared about so when somebody is pointed and opinionated we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic fairness and integrity or whatever to make them balance it out f c c world abounds in theories about michael powell one is that he can t make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries he regulates so he talks and talks and talks flamboyantly about the market in order to buy himself time another is that he s carrying water for the arbocks and the big cable companies another is that he is planning to run for the senate from virginia or to be appointed attorney general in a second bush term and doesn t want to do anything at the f c c that would diminish his chances another is that he s waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action so that he doesn t wind up going first and getting caught in the crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television networks in f c c world this is known as the powell doctrine of telecom after colin powell s idea that the united states should never commit itself militarily without a clear objective overwhelming force and an exit strategy and another is that he actually believes what he says and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural healthy and irreversible and more concentration would be just fine this is why elections matter reed hundt who isn t happy about what has become of his telecom act told me it s true that the f c c much more than say the war in afghanistan is a case in which a gore administration would be acting quite differently from the bush administration consumers might have noticed the difference by now but there s no question whether communications companies have noticed the arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would have done if gore had won next election they ll help the party that helped them if the republicans win policy will tilt further in the arbocks favor if they lose perhaps the arbocks rivals the long distance companies and the telecommunications upstarts with their friends now in power will stage a comeback america s present is not unrecognizably different from america s

not_spam,"introduction in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide , we have upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your products . this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days . please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade . summary of new features multiple children - a "" child "" product can be the "" parent "" of another child ( multiple links in a chain ) and different types of links can be placed against a single parent . static product bar prices - when you change a price in the product bar and hit the "" + "" or "" - "" button , the price stays - it does not reset to the amount in product properties until you logout . sorting - you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on the title of the field . for multiple sorts , hold down your "" shift "" key . parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified . ( e . g . the product bar might before have said : "" basis link - parent "" and now would say "" stand alone , parent "" ) . detailed feature descriptions multiple children the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together in a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent product b , which is in turn linked to parent product c . warning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when a customer attempts a transaction , the database must "" lock "" each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request . the database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks . "" vertical "" chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) are much slower to process than "" flat "" chains ( one parent with many children ) . large vertical chains should be avoided . related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parent product b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis link to the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopated basis link and a regular basis link . static product bar prices the new version of enrononline provides for "" sticky "" product bar price and volume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does not reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you have logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the "" + "" or "" - "" buttons . one of the benefits of setting these NUMBER s to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , if the price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harder for customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price update moves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . entering an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary , improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate . you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices - a new field for offset to last trade . this allows you to update the offset for products which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu . sorting / selecting the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old . you can now choose any field heading ( type , location , reference period , etc . ) and sort by that item . you can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key . example : if you select type and then location while holding the shift key , you will see your products sorted first by product type and then within each product type , by location ( in alphabetical order ) . if you right click on the product menu , you can choose from the same sort criteria , plus you can select "" sort by web order "" , which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website ( note however , that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing ) . when you select products , you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always , but now you can also hold down the key while making your selections . this allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another . parent products and f / x products one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed . the old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the product bar ( to the left of the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs ) . the new version does not show the type of link . this is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product . some traders may notice that their products which have f / x links are now identified with a stylised "" fx "" in the product list . this is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the parent , rather than managed individually . assistance as always , if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality , please contact the <NUM> hour help desk ( houston : <PHONE> , london : + <NUM> ( <NUM> ) <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> , australia : + <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> ) . general feedback if you have any comments on the new functionality , or suggestions for further functionality , please call david forster on <PHONE> . if you had previously suggested new functionality which didn ' t make it into this release , rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your requests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager .",kaggle_spam_mails,1223.0,0.0,6336,1212,1.0,0.00726010101010101,0.7722537878787878,0.0,0.026515151515151516,0.029356060606060608,0,0,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0.30363036303630364,49,24.24

(only executed contracts were released by the state in the last few weeks.) also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their nongas costs only. since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time. these contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves. finally we discounted at the libor rate, which is around <NUM>%/year. the stranded cost under these assumptions is approximately $<NUM> billion. the spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract. note: a negative ""mark-to-market"" equals a positive stranded cost. as before, this analysis is based upon enron's confidential forward curves. approval from tim belden is needed before this analysis can be released. alan comnes << file: stranded cost analysis structuring confidential.xls >> << file: stranded cost analysis structuring confidential.xls >>",kaggle_enron_emails,0.0,0.0,3442,470,1.0,0.09209761766414876,0.6417780360255665,0.0,0.10720511330621732,0.12986635676932015,0,0,93,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0.5723404255319149,26,17.40740740740741

not_spam,"(pst) from: <EMAIL> to: <EMAIL>, <EMAIL> marcello fontana sent an article from this week's businessweek on an apparently succesful policy to promote growth. economic viewpoint 'bribe' third world parents to keep their kids in school gary s. becker many well-meaning americans, including college students and religious organizations, have attacked nike inc. and other companies accused of using child labor in their overseas plants in poor nations. i agree that something should be done to save the children from dismal long-term economic prospects. however, effective policies must recognize that the fundamental cause of child labor is poverty, not greedy foreign and domestic employers. to combat the effects of poverty, poor mothers should be ''bribed'' to keep their children in school longer. really poor families in brazil, mexico, zaire, india, and many other nations put their children to work because their meager earnings help provide basic food and medicine for themselves and younger siblings. although parents may recognize that schooling would improve their children's marketable labor skills later in life, they cannot afford the ''luxury'' of taking them out of the labor market. in essence, child labor is the result of a conflict between short-term parental economic interests and the long-term interests of the children. adequate economic growth always eliminates child labor even without laws against it. but poor nations needn't wait until they grow richer. there are short-term solutions. many nations have compulsory schooling laws up to age <NUM> or so, but they are often hard to enforce, especially in rural areas and poor sections of large cities. families who want their children to work simply do not send them to school, or the children have very high absenteeism rates. officials are reluctant to punish parents of working children, perhaps because they recognize that the problem is not selfishness but poverty. share the burden. i propose a better way: give parents a financial incentive to keep their children in school longer. poor mothers should be paid if schools certify that their children attend classes regularly. parents would be strongly motivated to send their children to school--even when the children do not want to go--if these payments were not much below what the children could earn. most poor parents would happily continue. [a few sentences were cut here. i think they describe progresa program in mexico. i think this program pays a few dozen dollars a month to families that keep kids in school and immunized.] most poor mexican families earn only about $<NUM> a month. that large a percentage increase should have a noticeable effect on their behavior. poor families in less developed nations whose children do go to school are likely to withdraw their daughters when they become teenagers. this tends to perpetuate economic inequalities, since the children of women who receive little schooling also tend to be badly educated. progresa tries to combat this tendency to favor education of older sons by paying a little more to families that keep teenage daughters enrolled. narrow the gap. this pioneering mexican approach appears to be highly successful. an evaluation prepared for an october economics conference in chile shows that after only a couple of years, progresa significantly raised the schooling of children in very poor mexican families. it has also narrowed the education gap between girls and boys and reduced the labor force participation of boys. of course, governments need to find the tax revenue to finance programs like progresa. a good start would be to recognize that mexico and many other less developed nations typically spend disproportionately on universities and other education of their elites. redistributing some of this spending to the poor would both reduce inequality and stimulate faster economic growth. widespread basic education is more effective in promoting economic development than generous subsidies to the richer students who attend universities. child-labor critics could spend their time more fruitfully by attacking not the overseas employment policies of multinationals but the social policies of governments in poor nations that are really responsible for the prevalence of child labor there. these governments, and perhaps international organizations such as the world bank, should follow mexico's example and introduce programs that pay poor mothers to keep their teenage and younger sons and daughters in school and out of the labor force. david i. levine associate professor haas school of business ph: <NUM>/<NUM>-<NUM> university of california fax: <NUM>/<NUM>-<NUM> berkeley ca <NUM>-<NUM> email: <EMAIL> <URL>",kaggle_enron_emails,0.0,0.0,4723,730,1.0,0.011221681134871904,0.8066906627143765,0.0,0.021172983273343216,0.02773660808807961,0,0,15,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0.5246575342465754,40,17.804878048780488

we need the cpuc to adopt the comprehensive settlement, in order to keep norm quiet in gas accord ii. i'm working with the canadian association of petroleum producers in gas accord ii. their primary interest is moving to equalize the redwood and baja path rates. i also have done work recently for southern proposing a backbone-only rate for pg&e. keep me posted if and as your coalition develops. tom beach ----- original message ----- ; <<EMAIL>>; <<EMAIL>>; <<EMAIL>>; <<EMAIL>>; <<EMAIL>>; <<EMAIL>>; <<EMAIL>>; <<EMAIL>>; <<EMAIL>>; <<EMAIL>> sent: thursday, november <NUM>, <NUM> <NUM>:<NUM> am > greetings folks: > > as you know, the gas accord is coming to an end and pg&e's trying to figure > out where to go from here. i would argue that what happens with pg&e is > equally, if not more, important as what happens with socal. > > as you also know, we're faced with a retrograde puc that, by all accounts, > longs for the ""halcyon days"" of command-and-control regulation. as such, i > think it would be very useful, and cost-effective, to pull together the > effective coalition we established in the socalgas settlement. > > in that coalition, some of us contributed dollars and some contributed > experts. i think we should employ that approach again. i asked mike day, > who i think most agree, did a pretty good job of representing us in the > socal settlement, to make a proposal for representing us in the pg&e case. > mike's proposal is attached. finally, if there's anyone else you think we > ought to include in our coalition, please let me know. > > let me know what you think. > > hope all is well with you and yours. > > best, > jeff > > *************************************************************************** > > > > > > jeff: > > goodin, macbride is willing and able to represent a coalition of > end-users, marketers, and other interested parties in the pg&e gas accord > ii > proceeding in much the same fashion that it represented multiple parties in > the gri proceeding in both pg&e and socalgas settlements. we would propose > to split our monthly billings for legal fees and expenses equally between > the parties who agree to join such a coalition. in exchange for joining > the > coalition, parties would receive frequent updates on the status of > settlement talks and other proceedings, participate in conference calls to > reach decisions on coalition positions, and have the ability to call on the > gmsrd lawyers on the case in order to answer specific questions or provide > any other useful information. > > i envision using several attorneys for various portions of the > proceeding, including using associates and paralegals for research, and > other gmsrd partners with gas experience for preparation of pleadings, etc. > however, most of the face to face negotiating, including working with > commissioners and advisors as necessary, would be done by myself as lead > partner on the case. i have attached a fee schedule for the gmsrd > attorneys > who would likely have some involvement in the case. because the majority > of > this work will be done in <NUM>, these rates reflect our new <NUM> hourly > fees. however, in an effort to encourage participation in the coalition, > and because several potential members of the coalition are past or existing > clients, we propose to reduce our standard fees with a <NUM>% discount for all > participants in the coalition. with this discount, these would be the > lowest fees available to any of our clients in the coming year. > > i have not made any type of estimate of legal expenses for this > proceeding, as it is exceedingly difficult to forecast how protracted the > proceedings will be. once we begin participating in the proceeding and we > collectively decide how best to proceed in terms of actual participation in > the case, we can provide frequent budget reports and make more useful > budgetary estimates. if you require some type of estimation sooner than > that, please let me know. > > thank you for your interest in using our services. please > contact > me directly at (<PHONE> if you have any questions. > > mike day, partner > goodin, macbride, squeri, ritchie & day > > > > gmsrd fee schedule for gas accord ii proceedings > > michael day $<NUM> > > james mctarnaghan $<NUM> > > jeanne bennett $<NUM> > > alexandra ozols $<NUM> > > heather patrick, paralegal $ <NUM> > >",kaggle_enron_emails,0.0,0.0,5110,891,1.0,0.021526418786692758,0.7262230919765167,0.0,0.07025440313111546,0.07808219178082192,0,1,28,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.4511784511784512,34,25.457142857142856

'daily change' : shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume needed from enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the supply volumes arranged previously with enron prior to the current date. for the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., if the current gas day is <NUM>/<NUM>, then the change is computed with respect to the <NUM>/<NUM> request for <NUM>/<NUM>. note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was in fact effectuated). for tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed as the latest dth nomination requirement less the first-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the first-of-the-month to the fom supply for the (future) days shown.
