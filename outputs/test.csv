list in any way other than what is instructed below in steps number through number or you will lose out on the majority of your profits once you understand the way this works you will also see how it will not work if you change it remember this method has been tested and if you alter it it will not work people have tried to put their friends relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money but it does not work this way believe us some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed because if you do it will not work for you remember honesty reaps the reward this is a legitimate business you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time number after you have ordered all number reports take this advertisement and remove the name address of the person in report number this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune number move the name address in report number down to report NUMBER move the name address in report number down to report NUMBER move the name address in report number down to report NUMBER move the name address in report number down to report NUMBER insert your name address in the report number position please make sure you copy every name address accurately this is critical to your success take this entire letter with the modified list of names and save it on your computer do not make any other changes save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data to assist you with marketing your business on the internet the number reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails legally where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more there are number primary methods to get this venture going method number by sending bulk e mail legally let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume you and those involved send out only NUMBER e mails each let s also assume that the mailing receives only a NUMBER NUMBER of number response the response could be much better but let s just say it is only NUMBER also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e mails instead of only NUMBER each continuing with this example you send out only NUMBER e mails with a NUMBER response that is only number orders for report number those number people responded by sending out NUMBER e mails each for a total of NUMBER out of those NUMBER e mails only NUMBER responded with orders that s number people who responded and ordered report number those number people mail out NUMBER e mails each for a total of NUMBER e mails the NUMBER response

number half a million dollars your total income in this example is NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER number grand total NUMBER NUMBER s do not lie get a pencil paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it you will still make a lot of money remember friend this is assuming only number people ordering out of NUMBER you mailed to dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one NUMBER th of those people mailed NUMBER e mails each or more there are over number million people on the internet worldwide and counting with thousands more coming online every day believe me many people will do just that and more method number by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response we strongly suggest you start with method number and add method number as you go along for every number you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered that s it always provide same day service on all orders this will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report available reports the reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong it is simply about time time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you order each report by its number name only notes always send number cash u s currency for each report checks not accepted make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least number sheets of paper on one of those sheets of paper write the number the name of the report you are ordering your e mail address and your name and postal address place your order for these reports now report number the insider s guide

not_spam,begin forwarded message from ian andrew bell hello url date wed oct NUMBER NUMBER number pm us pacific to mike url cc foib url subject politicos re bowling for columbine opens this friday michael why is it that people who consider voting in an election an inconvenience would go to see a movie to show support for its message don t get me wrong i think this is the case people will go to see your movie as much to be entertained and informed as they will to express their malice and discontent towards not only the present regime in america but also the corrupt empty shallow pantomime which cast them into power in reality today the voting that takes place via the act of consumption far outweighs the impact caused by people going to a booth and dimpling the appropriate chad or some other such convoluted act of free democratic expression why because in america they believe in dollars dollars don t lie in practise they are the last frontier of truth in america universally accepted as expressions of fear desire passion and need compared to the swing of the almighty buck and jeb bush knows this a hanging chad has only the nethermost meaning given that fact i modestly propose an entirely new though wholly logical extension to the current democratic system in place in america i propose we augment and effectively replace the electoral system with a political stock market we should accept that politicians are entrepreneurs just like any other businessperson in america and embrace this fact in building an economic system which truly reflects their intent a politician should issue a constant number of shares dependent upon his tenure in government those shares should be traded on an open exchange say the g r e e d short of course for the global realists electoral exchange democratic politicians we believe in will see their stocks rise higher as faith in their ability to maintain office grows as the truth about their embezzling campaign funds for weekend trips to maui with their interns is revealed of course their fortunes will fall this represents an opportunity for the market forces those same forces which you intend to harness to express your own personal protest to voice their opinion on the quality of america s governance during the intervening four years between elections elections themselves will in effect become meaningless as they are now since their outcome will be influenced by the stock price of each and every congressman senator and presidential candidate just think of the coverage that could be given on msnbc strom thurman strom news quotes was down number today on fears that his latest heart operation will render him unable to attend senate armed services committee meetings until november this would provide rejuvenating content to the econo political news sector which has found post economic bubble coverage to be both tiresome and deoressing the establishment of this new stock exchange would of course create jobs for newly unemployed and governmentally retrained it systems engineers who could after passing the electoral securities exam become floor traders this would also allow for a convenient and very public method by which candidates could raise capital in the public markets to support their multi billion dollar campaigns the requirement for the support of legions of spin doctors permanent campaign managers and investor relations personnel would also create jobs perhaps even a new practice for ernst young arthur anderson et al insider trading scandals and misleading revenue declarations would of course catch martha stewart as an unwitting beneficiary thus spreading her influence to politics dividends if there are any on record at the close of a politician s career could be paid to current shareholders based on the holdings pensions funds could provide the institutional investment support necessary to underpin even the biggest dogs among the beltway set union funds brokerages and even pump and dump houses could benefit from meteoric rises in conservative candidates running in the southeast and the bush governmet would be allowed to place social security bets where they really mattered investors who lose their retirement life savings and support could rest assured that they were indeed robbed by crooks rather than poor investors although there s no way to protect any of these for worldcom like crashes ambitious inspired district attorneys could file criminal suits against candidates and campaign managers who underperform expectations thus assuring investors that their logic was not faulty instead they were merely defrauded by crooks and thieves on the whole i believe the system could work i could certainly work as well as our beloved securities trading industry and given the american electoral system s success at effectively expressing the will of the people it certainly couldn t do any worse in the meantime mike i think i ll go see your movie and

advance screenings i have attended has left the theatre with anything short of rage i truly believe this film has the potential to rock the nation and get people energized to do something this is not good news for junior and company not when they are trying to drag us into another war not when a crazed sniper is exercising his constitutional right to own a high powered rifle not when john ashcroft

the rest of the country gets to see it that is the nutty way our films are released if it doesn t have a big opening weekend you can kiss the film good bye therefore this weekend this film must be seen by millions of americans can you help me make that happen bowling for columbine is not a film simply about guns or school shootings that is only the starting point for my number hour journey into

nation at the beginning of the NUMBER st century a nation that seems hell bent on killing first and asking questions later it is a movie about the state sponsored acts of violence and terrorism against our own poor and how we have created a culture of fear that is based on the racial dilemma we continue to ignore and it s a devastating comedy this film is going to upset some pretty big apple carts no film has ever said the things i am saying in bowling for columbine i expect to be attacked i expect certain theatres will not show it for fear of retribution i expect that this movie will be

this weekend the rest of you can see it in a couple of weeks when it comes to your town a strong opening not only means that the rest of america will see this film it means that a good number of

b.c. hydro/powerex transmission market power that needs to be remedied. i would also ask milnthorp to reconsider his objection to participating while we're in litigation - i think on issues like this where we have common ground that are unrelated to the litigation, we need to rise above it and work to achieve the common objective. thanks. to: richard b sanders/hou/ect@ect, jeffrey t hodge/hou/ect@ect, mark e haedicke/hou/ect@ect, steven j kean/hou/ees@ees, richard shapiro/hou/ees@ees, aleck dadson/tor/ect@ect, mark palmer/corp/enron@enron, <EMAIL>, <EMAIL>, <EMAIL>, <EMAIL> cc: rob milnthorp/cal/ect@ect, peter keohane/cal/ect@ect transalta ""privileged and confidential"" please note: i have not sent this memo to gpc. <NUM>. meeting with alberta department of resource development rick shapiro, aleck dadson, and i met with two senior officials from the alberta department of resource development last week (larry charach, executive director, electricity and stan wenger, assistant deputy minister, gas & alberta markets) and it is our view that the adrd is not aware of project stanley based on some rather awkward questions we were asked by larry charach relating to our views on whether powerex has complied with the spirit of the rules in alberta. <NUM>. meeting with transalta and other alberta marketers i attended a meeting of alberta marketers last week hosted and organized by transalta's trading group. transalta proposed the companies in attendance form a coalition whose mandate and objective would be to retain counsel (u.s. and canadian) along with possibly other experts to assist the coalition in formulating a strategy designed to address concerns of the invited market participants with b.c. hydro power supply, b.c.hydro grid operations and powerex's alleged improper use of the network economy tariff provisions in the b.c. hydro wholesale transmission tariff. the attendees at the meeting included representatives from <NUM> of the <NUM> alberta ppa buyers, namely enron, transcanada power, engage energy, and enmax along with atco power, pancanadian, duke energy, and aquila. in addition, although bonneville power administration was not in attendance it was interesting that transalta advised that bpa shared transalta's concerns and was interested in working with this group to address these concerns. at the meeting transalta walked the group through a specific example of a situation that occurred in may <NUM> where transalta alleges that both it and transcanada power were blocked from using scheduled interruptible transmission capacity out of alberta by b.c. hydro power supply through its use of the network economy provisions in the b.c. hydro wholesale transmission tariff (which has a higher priority than interruptible transmission) during a period when prices were considerably higher in the pacific northwest than in alberta. as a result of the interruption of transalta's and transcanada's interruptible transmission reservation, transmission capacity between alberta/bc border and bc/us border became available and was immediately acquired by b.c. hydro power supply and used to support powerex exports during these periods into the u.s. transalta estimates the opportunity cost of this curtailment to transalta was $<NUM> million. transalta's frustration is no surprise to enron canada. i can advise that i wrote a memo to john lavorato dated march <NUM>, <NUM> in which i reviewed enron's concerns regarding the behavior of b.c. hydro power supply and powerex that is very similar to the allegations presented by transalta. the purpose of my memo to john l was to outline my initial thoughts on what enron canada may wish to do to attempt to stop this abuse and was focused on the idea of proceeding with a complaint to ferc that b.c. hydro power supply and powerex were exercising transmission market power. enron canada did not pursue this any further at the time. among the ideas reviewed by transalta with the group to address and rectify the abuse it alleges exist on the transmission path between alberta and the u.s. pacific northwest included: i) a complaint to adrd and a request they become involved; ii) a complaint to the alberta market surveillance administrator; iii) a complaint to ferc; iv) a complaint to the bcuc; v) a complaint to the b.c. government; vi) a complaint to the neb; vii) a complaint to the competition bureau; and/or viii) a nafta complaint. with respect to transalta's comments relating to the competition bureau, they advised the group that they have spoken to the competition bureau about their concerns and were told by the competition bureau that it is monitoring the alberta electricity market. based on the description provided by transalta of its discussions with the competition bureau and other comments made by transalta at the meeting i do not believe transalta is aware of project stanley. i believe the comments made by the transalta trader enron's trader last month about the competition bureau were not about project stanley but were in the context of transalta complaining to the competition bureau about b.c. hydro power supply and powerex's alleged abuse of the network economy provisions in the tariff. the next step in the coalition building process is a meeting on september <NUM>, <NUM> of those companies that wish to proceed to form a coalition. the idea is that the coalition members would work out the terms of confidentiality documentation prior to any member sharing historical information that it may wish to provide relating to potential abuses by b.c. hydro power supply or powerex. in addition they intend to begin to consider which of the possible courses of action described above would be most effective. it appears from the discussion at the initial meeting that the option that involves a complaint to ferc is the most favored by transalta at this time. finally, they intend to discuss a preliminary budget which transalta suggested may be in the range of $<NUM>,<NUM> cdn if the group elects to proceed with a complaint to ferc. there are without question a number of reasons why a decision that enron canada should not even consider having any part of this coalition in view of the project stanley matter is the safest strategy. having said this, enron canada has a significant commercial interest in seeing this coalition (with or without enron) achieve its objective to reduce or eliminate b.c. hydro power supply's and powerex's ability to use the network economy service to block its competitors from access to import capacity into alberta and export capacity into the u.s. enron canada's recent acquisition of the alberta sundance b ppa (<NUM> mw of capacity dispatch rights in alberta) makes this issue even more commercially significant as the ability to contract for transmission capacity without the risk of a reasonable probability of curtailment as a result of b.c. hydro power supply invoking network economy service would represent a significant risk mitigant for enron's sundance b long position. there is also some benefit of participating in the coalition to influence the direction it takes and to stay abreast of what it is doing. i have discussed the matter with rob milnthorp and he agrees that the decision to participate in the coalition would obviously have to be considered and approved by those managing the project stanley issue. if the decision of the project stanley team is that enron canada must steer clear of this coalition because of project stanley, then rob m and other commercial guys in ena who do business with powerex will not need to give further consideration to additional reasons why enron canada may elect not participate such as: i) the implications on enron canada's and ena's commercial relationship with powerex, ii) whether enron canada would be prepared to commit to anything more than attending the first meeting of the coalition with a view to understanding the nature of the confidentiality obligations, the favored course of action, and the budget, iii) whether enron canada would explicitly reserve the right to withdraw from the coalition at any time, and iv) whether enron would want to be in a coalition with bpa who i understand we believe may also be engaged in exercising transmission market power . to complicate this further, enron canada is presently being sued by transalta over the interpretation of the wording in two swap transactions and rob milnthorp has indicated that enron canada will not agree to participate in any coalition with transalta unless and until transalta discontinues this lawsuit. i look forward to your comments and feedback on this issue. regards, rob",kaggle_enron_emails,0.0,0.0,9887,1526,1.0,0.015070294325882472,0.7831495903711945,0.0,0.029129159502376857,0.04753717002124001,0,0,43,9,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0.3840104849279161,73,20.62162162162162

""all y'all is plural."" all y'all's is plural possessive."" <NUM>. get used to hearing, ""you ain't from around here, are you?"" <NUM>. don't be worried that you don't understand anyone. they don't understand you, either. <NUM>. the first southern expression to creep into a transplanted northerner's vocabulary is the adjective ""big ol,"" as in ""big ol truck,"" or ""big ol boy."" <NUM>. as you are cursing the person driving <NUM> mph in a <NUM>-mph zone, directly in the middle of the road, remember: all southern folks learned to drive on a john deere, and this is the proper speed and lane position for that vehicle. <NUM>. if you hear a southerner exclaim, ""hey, y'all, watch this!"" stay out of his way. these are likely the last words he will ever say, or worse still, that you will ever hear. <NUM>. most southerners do not use turn signals; they ignore those who do. in fact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with a southern license plate, you may rest assured that it was already turned on when the car was purchased. <NUM>. if it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth cooking, let alone eating. <NUM>. the wardrobe you always brought out in september can wait until december. <NUM>. if there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the most minuscule accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the local grocery store. it does not matter if you need anything from the store. it is just something you're supposed to do. <NUM>. satellite dishes are very popular in the south. when you purchase one,it is positioned directly in front of the house. this is logical, bearing in mind that the dish cost considerably more than the house, and should, therefore, be prominently displayed. <NUM>. be advised that in the south, ""he needed killin'"" is a valid defense. ========================== end part <NUM> =============================",kaggle_enron_emails,0.0,0.0,2888,491,1.0,0.036357340720221606,0.6900969529085873,0.0,0.05851800554016621,0.1038781163434903,1,1,31,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0.570264765784114,49,9.82

""there has been no resolution yet,"" daschle said. ""i would say that i think both [senate majority leader trent lott (r-miss.)] and i and our staffs are working to try to resolve his concern, which is what do you do in a tie ... you know, i think what happens in a tie is [that] you just keep talking until you break the tie."" daschle said he is looking for an ""opportunity to break through,"" but has yet to find one. regardless, daschle said he does not think ""tie votes are all that big a problem, either in conference or in committee."" with daschle voting in the affirmative, the senate march <NUM> approved <NUM>-<NUM> a cloture motion lott filed late march <NUM>. sen. paul wellstone (d-minn.), the bill's most outspoken opponent, argued passionately against cloture and sen. harry reid (d-nev.) foiled an attempt by lott to secure unanimous consent to prepare the bill for a conference with house members after the bill passed the senate march <NUM>. in general, the bills aim to force more bankruptcy filers to file under chapter <NUM>, which requires some repayment of debts, instead of chapter <NUM>. the bills are a copy of last year's conference report worked out between the house and the senate, which former president clinton pocket-vetoed in december. copyright , <NUM> by the bureau of national affairs, inc., washington d.c.",kaggle_enron_emails,0.0,0.0,3616,522,1.0,0.045077433628318585,0.7195796460176991,0.0013827433628318584,0.06526548672566372,0.08877212389380532,0,0,49,5,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6149425287356322,31,16.3125

b. pitching the idea to skilling for buyoff, and payment for the recs; c. possibly getting buyoff from the business units since this could change what they are currently paying for power. <NUM>. we discussed all of the above with peggy mahoney, and she asked us to take a stab at a comprehensive press release announcing all of the bells and whistles on the new building and our being the 1st fortune <NUM> company to go <NUM>% green in our headquarters. catherine mckalip thompson is working on the first draft. we need to determine if we can get the ""best"" press for this commitment (i.e. stories in the wsj and ny times). we determined that the message would need to be targeted, specifying the terms of our commitment....i.e. enron makes a commitment for <NUM> years to provide <NUM>% green for its headquarters in houston, making it the first fortune <NUM> company to....... the goal is to have a final plan and decision by april 20th when steve speaks to high level executives at a prelude to earth day ny on the topic of energy shock--crisis or opportunity: building economics and the environment. mike, we'll definitely need your continued support and assistance, particularly if this goes to skilling. i'll keep you posted on the progress. stacey ----- forwarded by stacey bolton/na/enron on <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> <NUM>:<NUM> pm ----- stacey bolton <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> <NUM>:<NUM> am to: scott gahn/hou/ees@ees, james m wood/hou/ees@ees, greg sharp/hou/ees@ees, richard ring/hou/ees@ees, steve woods/epsc/hou/ect@ect, michael payne/enron_development@enron_development, mike curry/enron@enronxgate, stan dowell/hou/ees@ees, catherine mckalip-thompson/enron communications@enron communications, peggy mahoney/hou/ees@ees cc: michael terraso/ots/enron@enron the meeting is confirmed for today at <NUM>:<NUM> p.m. in <NUM> m03. there are a couple of folks dialing in, and the number is <PHONE>, passcode: <NUM>#. i look forward to our discussion. ----- forwarded by stacey bolton/na/enron on <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> <NUM>:<NUM> am ----- stacey bolton <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> <NUM>:<NUM> pm to: scott gahn/hou/ees@ees, james m wood/hou/ees@ees, greg sharp/hou/ees@ees, richard ring/hou/ees@ees, steve woods/epsc/hou/ect@ect, michael terraso/ots/enron@enron, michael payne/enron_development@enron_development, mike curry/enron@enronxgate cc: steven j kean/na/enron@enron, mark palmer/corp/enron@enron, peggy mahoney/hou/ees@ees, janel guerrero/corp/enron@enron, jeffrey keeler/corp/enron@enron, catherine mckalip-thompson/enron communications@enron communications you are invited to a meeting next thursday (<NUM>/<NUM>) afternoon at <NUM>:<NUM> to discuss energy commodity and renewable energy credits for the enron building, center and stadium. there are a few efforts that are going on simultaneously and i thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the same page. as many of you might know, enron wind (michael payne) and ena (mike curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from our enron wind facility to match the consumption of the building and stadium (details attached below). if this proposal goes forward, enron would be the 1st fortune <NUM> company to ""go green"" in its headquarters building. couple this w/ our energy star award, and we have great environmental messaging. we'd like to highlight this announcement on earth day (april 22nd). the facilities folks are interested in switching from reliant to ees for actual commodity. it makes sense to work strategically together on win-win proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in our messaging. the focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals, and steps for moving forward. the meeting will be in eb50mo3 from <NUM>:<NUM>-<NUM>:<NUM>. please let me know if you or someone from your group can attend. stacey bolton environmental strategies enron corp <NUM>-<NUM>",kaggle_enron_emails,0.0,0.0,6254,959,1.0,0.03501758874320435,0.7348896706108091,0.0019187719859290054,0.0532459226095299,0.07435241445474897,0,0,70,8,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.4421272158498436,52,18.09433962264151

small just to see how it goes and we will assume you and those involved send out only NUMBER e mails each let s also assume that the mailing receives only a NUMBER NUMBER of number response the response could be much better but let s just say it is only NUMBER also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e mails instead of only NUMBER each continuing with this example you send out only NUMBER e mails with a NUMBER response that is only number orders for report number those number people responded by sending out NUMBER e mails each for a total of NUMBER out of those NUMBER e mails only NUMBER responded with orders that s number people who responded and ordered report number those number people mail out NUMBER e mails each for a total of NUMBER e mails the NUMBER response

moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one NUMBER th of those people mailed NUMBER e mails each or more there are over number million people on the internet worldwide and counting with thousands more coming online every day believe me many people will do just that and more method number by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response we strongly suggest you start with method number and add method number as you go along for every number you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered that s it always provide same day service on all orders this will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report available reports the reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong it is simply about time time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you order each report by its number name only notes always send number cash u s currency for each report checks not accepted make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least number sheets of paper on one of those sheets of paper write the number the name of the report you are ordering your e mail address and your name and postal address place your order for these reports now report number the insider s guide

basically, they've virtually acknowledged that they'll report sub-par earnings and higher loan losses this quarter and probably next. share prices could dip a bit more as those weak results get reported. but most of that bad news is history -- from here on out, the trends will be getting better, not worse. bank of america, which merged with nationsbank in <NUM>, is the largest u.s. bank. its stock is currently down to a paltry $<NUM>, just $<NUM> above the <NUM>-week low. for <NUM>, b of a should report earnings of about $<NUM> a share, just a single-digit gain from estimated <NUM> results. over the next five years, however, analysts think the bank could grow earnings by about <NUM> percent annually. including the <NUM> percent-plus dividend yield, that's quite a generous return for shares that are trading at only eight times earnings. chase manhattan presents a similar case. the bank, which is acquiring j.p. morgan, has been knocked down in anticipation of bad fourth-quarter results. chase is a major lender to troubled xerox, for example, so that could be a source of loan losses. nonetheless, the banking giant offers <NUM> percent projected long-term earnings growth and a <NUM> percent dividend yield. with a p/e of just over <NUM> times next year's estimated earnings, chase looks like a compelling buy as well. ======================= chat transcripts money's michael sivy identifies sectors and stocks that possess true value in a rocky market. <URL> tech investor david futrelle discusses the current state of the tech market and the outlook for various sectors. <URL> ======================= ### post your comments on michael's column at: <URL> to subscribe or unsubscribe to sivy on stocks, go to: <URL> earning releases and calls for the latest corporate earnings releases and online conference calls click on: <URL> * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * special internet offer!!! sign up for a risk-free issue of money magazine at <URL> or if you prefer call our toll-free number <PHONE> * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * we may, from time to time, contact you with offers for time inc. products and services which we think may be of interest to you. if you would prefer us not to contact you in this manner, and you did not indicate this preference at the time you signed up for the sivy on stocks online newsletter or any other time inc. online newsletters, please let us know by sending us an e-mail at <<EMAIL>>. additionally, from time to time we may provide your e-mail address to carefully chosen companies whose offers we think may be of interest to you. if you would prefer us not use your e-mail address in this manner, and you did not indicate this preference at the time you signed up for the sivy on stocks online newsletter or any other time inc. online newsletter, please let us know by e-mailing us at <<EMAIL>>.",kaggle_enron_emails,0.0,0.0,4965,875,1.0,0.021953675730110776,0.7178247734138973,0.0,0.06767371601208459,0.08418932527693856,3,2,32,7,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0.48114285714285715,48,17.857142857142858

(note: marcus nettelton has been leading our legal efforts on this deal, and can be reached at <NUM>-<NUM> to discuss contract issues). while the number of outstanding contract items are numerous at this point, my sense is that there are no real deal breakers on either their end or ours. in fact, they have agreed to many of the open issues in our previous contract with them for standard offer service, so they could potentially agree to our terms without much delay, thereby potentially making execution on monday a possibility. attached is a draft dash for this deal . i request that you review it promptly with a goal to have each of your signoffs for this deal in principle by mid-afternoon on monday so as to enable us to transact on monday if necessary. the parameters that are still in motion are: (<NUM>) price (again to e updated monday morning), but will maintain same npv value; (<NUM>) term (they may end up just going for <NUM> months); and (<NUM>) exact volume they source from us. as for volume, they indicated they may want to go with us for something less than <NUM>% of their requirements for the first <NUM> months (they estimate anywhere between <NUM>-<NUM>%), and then potentially a smaller percentage for the second <NUM> months if they do end up doing a <NUM>-month deal. please feel free to call me (<PHONE> office, <PHONE> home over the weekend) if you would like to discuss in more detail. berney aucoin in structuring will be on point to run internal traps on monday as may be necessary. thanks in advance. regards john",kaggle_enron_emails,0.0,0.0,3090,511,1.0,0.05566343042071197,0.7210355987055016,0.0,0.05469255663430421,0.05825242718446602,0,0,42,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5616438356164384,19,25.55

if so, which offices would they be trading with and what kind of products would be traded? for example, would there be physical settlement (or delivery) of product in japan to the japanese customers or would there be only financial derivatives traded?

(ene) alleging breach of a power sales contract. tva cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen expenses contributing to the government-owned utility's inability to meet its debt-reduction forecast. according to the documents, obtained by dow jones newswires, the alleged breach of contract contributed to a $<NUM> million shortfall during fiscal year <NUM>. tva was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case, which is under a court protective order. ""a major power provider elected not to perform under the contract,"" said david smith, tva's chief financial officer, when asked friday to elaborate on the line item in the information provided to tva's distribution utility customers. but after consulting with attorneys, smith revealed that enron was the subject of the claim. tva alleged breach of contract after enron sought a declaratory judgment order from the u.s. district court in chattanooga, tenn., in february, stemming from a dispute over a long-term sales agreement, an enron spokesman said monday. in march, tva filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of contract, a tva spokesman said monday. but the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract, or to elaborate further on the dispute, citing the judge's protective order. tva said enron sought the court seal. the dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the houston-based energy giant and tva, a government-owned utility that ranks among the largest u.s. power producers. the relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to the lucrative u.s. midwest power market, which saw extreme price spikes during hot weather in the summers of <NUM> and <NUM>. after the summer of <NUM> - in which power that typically sells for between $<NUM> and $<NUM> per megawatt-hour spiked as high as $<NUM>,<NUM> per megawatt-hour - enron cited a study showing that tva's power grid represented the only unconstrained transmission pathways into the midwest. tva experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were spiking upward. enron built gas-fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access across tva's system. after the summer of <NUM> saw a repeat in extreme price volatility, enron began complaining that tva was unfairly denying transmission service by failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service requests. a tva spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement over the government utility's handling of transmission-access requests. but the filing of the court case occurred at the same time enron went public with its complaints about tva's transmission service. in february, enron released a letter to energy secretary bill richardson asking for the government's help, charging that tva was unfairly giving its own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while enron's requests were gathering dust. enron later dropped the matter, saying that tva was processing its transmission service requests on a timely basis. -by bryan lee, dow jones newswires, <PHONE>, <EMAIL> copyright , <NUM> dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved.",kaggle_enron_emails,0.0,0.0,10920,1636,1.0,0.03406593406593406,0.7451465201465202,0.0002747252747252747,0.05036630036630037,0.07078754578754579,0,1,120,8,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0.46026894865525675,92,17.591397849462364

(and .tom9 for -- just kidding!) icann has taken some heat for rejecting .kids and .xxx for porn sites, but icann staff held firm, saying that defining kids' sites would be problematic, and that porn sites couldn't be forced to take an .xxx suffix. the board's <NUM> members will act thursday and it's reported that the new domains will be operational in q2 <NUM>. netpliance (nasdaq: npli) announced sunday it would cut <NUM>% of its workforce and refocus its business away from its poor-selling i-opener internet appliance, which combined the device with internet access and netpliance's consumer portal. netpliance reported friday a $<NUM>.<NUM> million loss, or $<NUM>.<NUM> per share, versus a loss of $<NUM>.<NUM> million, or $<NUM>.<NUM> per share, a year ago. the company intends to reorganize into two business units: netpliance.net, offering next-generation services and hosted applications to broadband service providers, and netpliance ipg, which will develop core infrastructure products to be installed in data centers, points-of-presence, and residential access devices. though the company had $<NUM>.<NUM> million in cash at the end of the september quarter, it's hard to see how it can expect to make headway in this area already filled with cash-rich competitors. a federal court in delaware has ruled against genechip dna array maker affymetrix (nasdaq: affx) in favor of the u.k.'s oxford gene technology in a patent infringement case involving technology fundamental to affymetrix's product technology. two weeks ago a british appeals court ruled in favor of affymetrix that it had a license when it purchased part of beckman coulter (nyse: bec) in <NUM>. according to reports, the u.s. court agreed with the british court on the beckman coulter-affymetrix license transfer, so the sole issue is a <NUM>-month period when affymetrix paid no royalties to oxford. oxford sought $<NUM> million -- which will not be tripled because the court reportedly found that affymetrix did not willfully or knowingly infringe the patents. affymetrix expects about $<NUM> million in revenues from its genechip arrays and related equipment this year. ceo stephen fodor stated that ""we don't think [the decision] will have a long-term effect. our future is secure. so we're now talking about the past -- of about <NUM> months at the most and no trebling of damages.'' reuters reports that chip giant intel (nasdaq: intc) will announce two new celeron processors chips, running at <NUM> megahertz and <NUM> megahertz, to further its hold on the sub-$<NUM>,<NUM> pc market in the face of stiffening competition from advanced micro devices (nyse: amd). amd currently has the speediest chip on the market and is said to be undercutting intel on price by <NUM>%. the <NUM> will cost $<NUM> per thousand and the <NUM> will cost $<NUM> per thousand, giving you a pretty good idea of where the prices are in a low-cost pc box. intel said that compaq (nyse: cpq) and hewlett-packard (nyse: hwp) will introduce systems using the chips. _________________________________________________________________ editors' pick todd lebor shares four simple yet profound investing mantras he learned from his grandfather. <URL> _______________________________________________________________ -news & commentary <URL> -fool community <URL> -post of the day <URL> -latest fribble <URL> -latest market NUMBER s <URL> ____________________________________________________________ my portfolio: <URL> my discussion boards: <URL> my fool: <URL> fool.com home: <URL> my e-mail settings: <URL> sponsored by: investorplace.com cisco. intel. oracle. microsoft. is now the time to buy or sell these and other top technology holdings?

""in essence, we are doing exactly what gov. gray davis has suggested. but if these restrictions are not lowered, we will run out of power from these units very quickly,"" perkins said in a statement. perkins proposed that emissions hours not be counted against reliant's yearly allotment whenever the plants are called into operation to help prevent blackouts. reliant's mandalay, etiwanda and ellwood plants each face annual air pollution limits imposed by the south coast air quality management district and the santa barbara county and ventura county air pollution control districts. reliant has asked for extensions from each of the districts. ""there's no question we are in an emergency situation. we will consider every option available"" to avert blackouts, said davis spokesman roger salazar. but he said the administration had not seen reliant's proposal. davis also will consider paying businesses to fire up their backup generators when necessary to avoid outages, salazar said. running the generators would let the businesses disconnect from the state's power grid, freeing up electricity for other uses. the proposals have consumer and environmental groups outraged. ""it's a short-term fix that will have potential long-term health consequences,"" said paul knepprath of the american lung association of california. the state should instead cut demand by encouraging more conservation, the lung association and <NUM> other consumer and environmental groups said in a letter to davis on wednesday. davis already is promoting conservation, but blackouts have health and public safety consequences too, salazar said. the use of backup generators is being proposed by the administration's top energy advisers, but davis has not yet seen the proposal, salazar said. the governor is willing to ""explore every conceivable option for generation this summer,"" salazar said. the twin developments come the same week the administration cut by <NUM> percent its estimate of new power generation that will be available this summer. davis now projects <NUM>,<NUM> additional megawatts, <NUM>,<NUM> megawatts short of his original estimate. a megawatt is enough power for about <NUM> homes.",kaggle_enron_emails,0.0,0.0,4034,621,1.0,0.025532969757064948,0.7816063460585028,0.0,0.03396132870599901,0.039167079821517105,0,0,27,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0.5120772946859904,32,18.818181818181817

""participant behavior guidelines"". the participant behavior guidelines contain very broad language but are intended to provide market participants with guidance from the pool on the types of activities that it considers to constitute anti-competitive behavior. it identifies three categories of ""undesireable practices"" namely: (a) sharing of competitive information, (b) abuse of dominant position (which includes physical or economic witholding of facilities or energy so as to adversely impact upon the efficient, fair, and openly competitive operation of the market), and (c) other practices including conduct that would cause a material change in price. in my view, this new rule does not extend any additional powers to the power pool or the market survelliance administrator beyond the already broad authority given to the msa in section <NUM>.<NUM> of the electric utilities act. it is my sense from conversations i had with stakeholders at the ippsa conference that the power pool's motivation behind this new rule was to send a message to powerex and the ppa owners that the power pool is concerned about their market power and is/will be monitoring them. we need to be aware of these rules so we can mitigate the risk of our business not being conducted within them. it may be worthwhile for peter and i to consolidate the relevant eua provisions and the pool rules into one reference resource for the commercial group. regards, rob ---------------------- forwarded by robert hemstock/cal/ect on <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> <NUM>:<NUM> am --------------------------- kayan brown <<EMAIL>> on <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM> am to: ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, robert hemstock/cal/ect@ect, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>>, ""'<EMAIL>'"" <<EMAIL>> > <<rule changes proposed letter_mar23.doc>> <<rule changes proposed letter_mar23.txt>> <<code changes proposed_mar23.doc>> attached please find a covering letter and above-noted documents including your feedback to be presented for approval at the upcoming council meeting scheduled for march <NUM>, <NUM>. please note the covering letter is in ""text only"" format and the rule and code changes are in ""ms word"" format, because the rules and code changes would not be legible in ""text only"" format. if you can read text only documents please call the power pool and we will fax you the attached information instead. thank you. kayan brown power pool. -

""we are at a point of renegotiating the power purchase agreement with dabhol power co. a committee has been constituted with the government of india participation. i am hopeful of a positive outcome,"" bansal told dow jones newswires in a telephone interview. he said he hadn't heard anything from dpc's management on the preliminary termination notice. ""it's true that the dpc board has authorized the company's managing director to issue a preliminary termination notice. i am not sure why, when or whether he will use it,"" bansal said. the preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that end in the abandonment of the project, agreed to by investors when the joint venture was formed. bansal said that if the preliminary notice of termination is issued by the dpc's managing director, there will be a si <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> business line (the hindu) copyright (c) <NUM> kasturi & sons ltd (ksl); source: world reporter (tm) - asia intelligence wire mumbai, april <NUM>. dabhol power company's (dpc) overseas lenders have a guarantee cover of about rs <NUM>,<NUM> crore from the idbi-led consortium of indian lenders. if the enron-sponsored project is terminated, the indian lenders will have to incur the additional burden over and above the funds they have already sunk in. this is in addition to the union government's guarantee of about rs <NUM>,<NUM> crore to overseas lenders. sources said according to the agreements between the overseas lenders, the indian financiers and the government, the ""total pay-out in the event of termination would not be less than the entire foreign debt"". of the total debt of close to $<NUM>.<NUM> billion, about <NUM> per cent has been already disbursed by lenders of which <NUM> per cent has been lent by overseas entities. if the ""blame"" of termination finally comes to rest on any indian entity, the penalty payable to enron would amount to about rs <NUM>,<NUM> crore. irrespective of the payments to be made to enron - promised returns on premature termination - the foreign lenders are secured by the word of domestic financial institutions and not just the central and state governments. sources said this is one of the major reasons indian lenders are opposed to premature termination of the project, apart from their loans being ""unsecured"". at the dpc board meeting in london, idbi had voted against the resolution to initiate termination. the sources said enron wants to ""see some concrete and positive signals"" from the government within about three weeks that it is ""serious"" about the project. a positive signal, according to them, would mean a commitment that phase ii would continue on schedule and the power produced would be lifted completely. it also wants the ""first phase to be up and running at full steam without hindrance"". however, even if foreign creditors have to be paid off, it is unlikely to be in a single settlement. domestic lenders may have to negotiate some kind of an arrangement to repay the foreign debt in tranches. another possibility, albeit a remote one, is that the new entity that takes over the project will also take over the foreign debt. meanwhile, the expert panel to be formed for renegotiation of the power purchase agreement will include all members of the godbole committee, a state government official said. it will also include one member each from the union finance ministry, the central electricity authority, the state finance ministry and the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board. he also said the state government will appoint the arbitrator before may <NUM>. - archana chaudhary - dinesh narayanan enron not interested in completion of dabhol project <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> press trust of india limited (c) <NUM> pti ltd. mumbai, apr <NUM> (pti) the us energy major enron-promoted dabhol power company (dpc) has said it is ""not interested"" in completing the usd three billion power project in western indian state of maharashtra, following non-payment of dues by the state electricity board (mseb) and federal government's refusal to honour the rs <NUM>.<NUM> billion counter-guarantee. in dpc's board meeting held in london on april <NUM>, enron india managing director k wade cline and dpc president neil mcgregor made it clear they were ""not very keen for completion of the project as the management felt that both the state government and the centre (indian government) were undermining the gravity of the situation"", a senior state government official who attended the meeting told pti here sunday. cline told the dpc directors that since the state government had ""not shown"" any serious interest in dissolving the imbroglio, dpc and its international lenders were ""not in favour of continuing the project"". when contacted dpc spokesperson refused to comment. the fate of dpc's <NUM>,<NUM> mw project, which is <NUM> per cent complete, hangs in balance, since the indian financial institutions (fis) led by idbi have stopped funding the debt portion of the project, with around <NUM> per cent of the usd <NUM>.<NUM> billion worth total disbursement already pumped in. ""naturally, we have stopped disbursement as we think that it is indeed a loss-making proposition, as of now. if mseb begins paying, we would go ahead with our funding as well"", an idbi official said. according to the idbi official, this very stand adopted by indian lenders has upset the dpc management and enron top bosses in houston as well. in the meeting, cline had informed that dpc's foreign lenders had put up a condition before the company, that they would cough up the required usd <NUM> million, ""only if indian fis fulfill their debt component"", the official added. other than the issuance of termination notice to mseb, another issue that rocked the heated meeting was godbole review committee's strong stand on separating the usd <NUM> million liquified natural gas terminal from dabhol project. ""on what basis has godbole committee asked for renegotiation of the lng facility? ...do they have any international expertise in purchase of this particular fuel?"", cline had questioned the mseb representatives in london. he asked whether the high-powered panel had ""ever consulted any expert before commenting on ""take or pay"" clause of the lng contract which is mandatory feature worldwide"". in its recommendations made public two weeks ago, the godbole panel had recommended renegotiation of the five million tonnes lng terminal facility and dpc's shipping agreements with oman lng and adgas. ""the ministry for petroleum and natural gas should examine the feasibility of integrating dabhol facility within the broad plans of lng imports into india and also necessary pipeline investments in this regard"", the panel recommended. while the <NUM> mw phase-i is already operational, the <NUM>,<NUM> mw phase-ii is scheduled for commissioning in january <NUM>.

""the total amount of money, with everything included, is about $<NUM>.<NUM> billion,"" a bank spokeswoman told reuters. the multilateral lender's board meets on thursday to vote on its contribution to the package that has three central elements -- two related to efficiency and distribution and a third to power grid's diversification into telecommunications. ""part of the world bank loan, if approved, will go to support the first phase of laying fiber-optic cables across the (power grid) network,"" the spokeswoman said. india threw open its long-distance telecommunications sector last august, and power grid, which has a network of <NUM>,<NUM> miles (<NUM>,<NUM> km) of transmission lines, plans to provide end-to-end bandwidth services. the loan package is unusual in that it would be granted directly to the state-owned power distribution utility, rather than to the sovereign government of india. the government is, however, guarantor to the program. the bank spokeswoman declined to speculate on whether the board's decision would be influenced by the crisis brewing in india's power sector with u.s. energy company enron corp.

""the bank is engaged at the national level and the state level in power reforms, broadly,"" the spokeswoman said, declining to comment specifically on enron and the questions that its potential pullout from india raised about reform in the mainly state-run power sector. houston-based enron took a major step on wednesday toward bailing out of an almost complete $<NUM>.<NUM> billion power project on the west coast of india in a bitter dispute over pricing and unpaid bills. the dispute threatens to undermine already weak foreign private investor confidence in direct investments in india, which totaled just $<NUM>.<NUM> billion last year -- a fraction of china's $<NUM>.<NUM> billion. the world bank would make any loan to power grid on its usual repayment terms of <NUM> years with five years grace with an interest rate at an unspecified margin above the london interbank offered rate (libor). the spokeswoman said other lenders in the program included germany's kreditanstalt fuer wiederaufbau (kfw) with up to $<NUM> million and domestic indian institutions. if passed by the bank's washington-based board next week, the world bank loan agreement would then be signed in india by representatives from the bank in delhi, power grid and government officials. the funds would then be available for draw down within <NUM> days. uk: scottish power mulls portland bid - paper <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> reuters english news service (c) reuters limited <NUM>. london, april <NUM> (reuters) - scottish power is considering a move to bolster its operations on the west coast of the u.s. via a bid for oregon-based portland general in a deal worth up to $<NUM> billion, according to a report in sunday's observer newspaper. portland's owner, enron, last week broke off talks with the u.s. utility sierra pacific on a $<NUM>.<NUM> billion sale, opening the door to scottish power, it said. the article said portland, which sells power to <NUM>,<NUM> customers around the state capital of oregon, would be a perfect fit for the scottish power's pacificorp unit in the u.s. northwest, which it bought in <NUM>. the paper said scottish power's intentions would come under scrutiny when the company reports results next week. scottish power could not be immediately reached for comment. india: save dabhol project <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> business line (the hindu) copyright (c) <NUM> kasturi & sons ltd (ksl); source: world reporter (tm) - asia intelligence wire the decision of the dabhol power company board - at its meeting in london on wednesday - ""to authorise the managing director to issue a notice of termination on the contract to sell <NUM> mw of power in india"" is important for the message it sends to new delhi, the maharashtra government and the maharashtra state electricity board: closing down the project would be a real option at the right time. in the normal course - especially in view of all that has happened over the past few months (including dpc invoking the political force majeure clause in the power purchase agreement) - it would have been no surprise had a final decision on termination been taken at the board meeting itself. that this has not happened means the project can still be salvaged and this should now become the focus of all the parties. but this will not be easy not merely because of the defects in the ppa (from the indian standpoint, that is) but also because of the bad blood unnecessarily created between the two sides. to take but one example: the mseb went ahead to clear its march bill to dpc 'under protest' despite an earlier communication (after the payment of the february bill) from the enron india managing director, mr k. wade cline, that the company ""would not and will not recognise any payments made as being 'under protest'."" the mseb's reported response was that it was not taking any notice of this stand because mr wade cline's ""letter had no legal standing,"" adding, ""we will continue to pay our bills 'under protest'. let them dispute it."" this is no way to engage in a dispute as it detracts from the main effort to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution and instead focusses on ephemeral and secondary issues that have little bearing with the core problem. now that the focus will once again shift to india from london, hopefully both sides will try their best to arrive at a settlement, which actually means they will have to climb down from their positions. one, the mseb cannot be expected to continue paying through its nose for power which it does not even consume, not merely because this is unfair and unjust but also because the board simply does not have the funds. further, if it does not make any sense for the mseb to be part of such an arrangement (even if it is of its own making), it makes even less sense for the maharashtra government and the centre to be penalised for a widely-acknowledged infirmity in the ppa. as for dpc, being the hardnosed investor it is, it cannot but be aware of the financial untenability of certain aspects of the ppa. in such a situation, provided the principal promoters like enron corporation want to continue operating in india (of which one is not very certain), the sensible - perhaps even 'ethical' - course would be to agree to an amended ppa which would at least be equitable to the two sides. the central point in the issue is that the <NUM>,<NUM> mw power project (to be completed by the year-end) is an asset to the nation's infrastructure, implying at once that letting it go to seed is no option at all. at the same time, the dpc promoters must be allowed to make their money - not on the scale allowed by the existing, one-sided and patently unfair ppa but at a level which will make the ppa seem a fair document in keeping with the norms applied to such projects. this means the ppa will have to be renegotiated - a path already accepted by the indian side but on which dpc is yet to make its stand clear. admittedly, top dpc officials have let it be known that they are willing to talk (preferably with the centre). so all may not be lost vis-a-vis the dabhol power plant. india: systemic changes needed for sebs, says prabhu <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> business line (the hindu) copyright (c) <NUM> kasturi & sons ltd (ksl); source: world reporter (tm) - asia intelligence wire new delhi, april <NUM>, the union power minister, mr suresh prabhu, has informed the lok sabha that ""systemic changes"" need to be introduced and institutionalised if the chronically sick state electricity boards (sebs) were to be restructured on an enduring basis. responding to the concern expressed by the senior congress leader, mr madhavrao scindia, during question hour, mr prabhu said that the outstanding dues of the sebs were a staggering rs <NUM>,<NUM> crore. the government has constituted an expert group to recommend measures for one-time settlement of outstanding dues of the sebs towards central public sector understandings as also the dues from the central public sector units to state power utilities. the expert group headed by the planning commission member, dr montek singh ahluwalia, would submit its report before the end of this month. it would suggest a strategy for capital restructuring of sebs including the provision of structural adjustment loans so as to enable them to tide over the present financial crisis, make them operationally viable and improve their credit rating. he agreed with mr scindia that the one-time solution for outstanding dues should be an all-time solution and there should not be any recurrence of this problem in future. tracing the genesis of the problems of the sebs to the difference in the cost of energy generation and the cost of tariff which entails a loss of re <NUM> per unit, mr prabhu said this year the power stations would be generating <NUM> billion units. that is why restructuring of the sebs on a permanent basis was a must. the minister said that the government was working on a package. accordingly, all the consumers should be metered and all the distribution centres would be treated as profit centres and all the sebs would have to give a projection of their performance before the year begins. when mr scindia drew the minister's attention to a point on the liabilities of the enron company which he described as damaging the interest of the country, the state government and the power company resulting in ""massive confusion,"" mr prabhu clarified that the agreement was between the state government of maharashtra and the enron company and the centre's role is 'limited' in giving counter-guarantee to the guarantee provided by the state government. he said a standing committee has been constituted under the ministries of finance, power and law and the petroleum and natural gas would also be roped in to resolve the tangle. sops for shipping urged: when mr rajaiah malayala, and mr p.c. thomas, demanded sops for the indigenous shipping industry which has been facing rough weather, the minister of shipping, mr arun jaitley, said that the finance minister has responded to the concern of the shipping industry while moving the finance bill on wednesday. as the domestic shipping industry has to improve its competitiveness globally, efforts would continue to be made with the department of revenue to ensure that the domestic shipping industry does not get bogged down by harsh tax regime. he conceded that in most countries the shipping industry was operating on a zero-tax regime. fast-track courts: in response to a question by mr chandra bhusan singh, mr jaitley, who is also the minister of law, justice and company affairs, said that to clear the huge pendency of cases in the various courts in the country, it is proposed to set up <NUM>,<NUM> courts on a fast-track basis. - our bureau india: enron not to affect india ratings: s&p <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> business line (the hindu) copyright (c) <NUM> kasturi & sons ltd (ksl); source: world reporter (tm) - asia intelligence wire mumbai, april <NUM>. india's sovereign rating would remain unaffected by aggravation of the enron dispute, according to international rating agency standard & poor's. ""the ratings are unaffected because the issues with dabhol power company (dpc) are not about a default on debt. this is a technical distinction but an important one. the government incurs many types of liabilities, but we do not consider all of them to be 'debt' for our purpose,"" mr joydeep mukherji, head of sovereign ratings, s&p told business line in a mailed reply. ""a counter-guarantee backing the maharashtra guarantee on the state electricity board's obligation to pay dabhol is not 'debt' as far as our ratings go,"" he said. with the enron-sponsored dpc teetering on the brink, many quarters feared that it would ""seriously impair foreign investor sentiment"" and international rating agencies would downgrade the country. mr mukherji agrees that the issue would hit sentiment. ""our rating is a judgement on the ability to pay 'debt' fully and on time. it is not an indication of profitability or a view about investment prospects. the enron episode will certainly hurt foreign investor sentiment but that is separate from a debt rating,"" he said. enron is about the only foreign investor left in the country's power sector. many players such as cogentrix and powergen have already exited their respective ventures. with that backdrop, mr mukherji said, ""at a broader level, not about the rating itself, the episode is very bad for india. regardless of the merits of the dabhol case, it sends a clear and negative signal to potential foreign investors, going beyond the energy sector. india has lots of consumers, farmers, and industries willing to pay lots of money for reliable, guaranteed power supply. ""many indian and foreign groups are eager to set up plats to provide that power and make a profit. it should have been a win-win situation for all sides. instead, the only result after a decade of reform is that load-shedding is as bad as ever and most private investors in power have packed up and left in bitterness."" however, a view, that projects such as dabhol power are not viable in a country with low resources and paying capacity, is gaining currency. some analysts ask when utilities in california, where delinquency levels are close to zero, could not afford the power sold by independent producers such as enron, what chances of survival does mseb have. - dinesh narayanan maharashtra to appoint godbole to lead renegotiations with dpc <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> press trust of india limited (c) <NUM> pti ltd. mumbai, apr <NUM> (pti) the government of the western indian state of maharashtra has decided to appoint former bureaucrat madhav godbole, who had recently reviewed dabhol power company's (dpc) power purchase agreement (ppa) with maharashtra state electricity board (mseb), to lead the expert team for renegotiating the ppa following the us energy major's threat to terminate the agreement. an official order would be issued on monday and the experts' committee would have to consider the recommendations and terms of reference put forth by the godbole review committee, state government sources said here saturday. sources said no time-frame had been set, but ""it will all depend on the other side (dpc) also participating in resolving the imbroglio"".

well, for the simple reason that, two days earlier, the clique of <NUM> lenders to the project had advised enron not to terminate the contract. fortified with the knowledge that enron couldn't possibly go against the advice of the lenders, the bansal-lal duo assumed the board agenda was almost infructuous. indeed, the lenders had made a strong case against the termination of the contract, noting that since <NUM> per cent of the construction was already over, no purpose would be served by precipitating matters. even the foreign lenders, whose loans are covered by the central government counter-guarantee, were persuaded by the indian lenders industrial development bank of india (idbi), icici and the state bank of india that the bankers' primary business was to invest money in a project that would return revenue streams over a period of time, and not simply to recover their principal invested. preliminary reports of the lenders' meeting suggest the foreign lenders who were initially planning to pack their bags and escape the uncertainties of the project, saw merit in the argument that they might lose a significant chunk of their india exposure at one go. fresh investment avenues are not coming up, and the foreign lenders didn't want to be left out of the india pie. after all, in the business of global banking, it is only association with existing projects that begets fresh opportunities. but despite the lenders' posturing and well-intentioned advice for the enron representatives on the dpc board, the latter wasn't one to give up so easily, especially after venturing this far just to show its displeasure with the way matters were progressing. dpc has, all along, argued that it has a watertight contract and that mseb should honour its obligations under the contract. it was only after the state government refused to honour its guarantee, and even the central government seemed to side with the maharashtra government rather than honour its own counter-guarantee, that dpc decided to pull the trumps in its contract. it had to make a point: if mseb and the local governments weren't willing to pay up what was due, they would have to pay up all the penalty clauses for termination of the contract. so despite the lenders' advice, the board chose to let the sword hang tantalisingly closer to mseb's head. it authorised enron (india) managing director wade cline to serve the notice as and when he deemed fit. if the indian side was talking tough all this while to force dpc to accept its stand on renegotiating a lower tariff, the latter had dangled the threat of phenomenal penalties if the government strayed off the course charted in the power purchase agreement. as the resolution was carried through, the mseb chairman and energy secretary realised their bluff was called. the smiles vanished. but they still put up a brave front. speaking from london, mseb officials denied that they had been checkmated: ""this does not mean that they will issue the notice immediately. cline has only been authorised to do so,"" they said. but they did admit that the situation had not been defused in spite of the fact that the government had made some conciliatory moves. just before the dpc board meet, the union government had announced on april <NUM> that a committee, comprising representatives of the state government, mseb and nominees from the centre, would be set up to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with dpc to get lower tariffs. in retrospect, lenders say, enron seems to have realised that they had no option but to sit with the state government and thrash out fresh tariffs. after all, it couldn't afford to let payments being held up for months on end. moreover, if mseb was not drawing enough power from the <NUM> mw phase i of the project, claiming financial inability to service the purchases, what is the guarantee that it would draw power when the larger <NUM>,<NUM> mw phase ii comes up? putting up capacities when the goods don't sell doesn't make sense. so to salvage the investment, enron realised that it had little option but to renegotiate with the state government. then it simply became a matter of fortifying positions ahead of the negotiations. in short, it is trying to convey that it will negotiate but it better be a deal that satisfies the houston (texas)-based company. the problem as far as the dpc is concerned is the high tariff it charged the mseb. these have been as high as rs <NUM> per unit at times. critics of the project, consisting of politicians, bureaucrats and ngos, have said that this is crippling mseb. the fixed cost alone for the first phase of <NUM> mw is rs <NUM> crore per month. this means that mseb has to pay dpc rs <NUM> crore whether it buys power or not. this fixed charge will rise to rs <NUM> crore per month when the second phase is commissioned by december <NUM>. for the mseb, which rakes in around rs <NUM> crore per month, the prospect of paying out rs <NUM> crore to one supplier is a nightmare. what does the immediate future offer? in the next few weeks expect enron and the negotiating committee to open direct parleys. there will be hard bargaining on both sides. by deciding to to send its nominees into the renegotiating committee, the government of india has made it clear that it is taking the issue very seriously. earlier, the government was content to treat it as a fight between the state government, mseb and dpc. but the fact that unpaid bills were being claimed from its own account, through the counter-guarantee clauses, seems to have forced the centre to be much more careful in what the two sides agree on. indeed, the central government has just realised what a mess it had got itself into. it had sided with mseb when it decided not to honour the counter guarantee invoked by dpc for the december, <NUM>, bill of rs <NUM> crore. but that got the centre embroiled in an arbitration proceeding over this amount. and, above all, the central government, being the sovereign, cannot be seen as being so petty as to wriggle out of its obligations. one false move and the entire worth of the centre's word would be laid to waste. playing on that, enron is trying to show that any renegotiations on its part are in the nature of mercy concessions: since it has a valid signed contract, no one messes with it. what this means is that there is no way the state government, mseb and the government of india can shy away from their obligations of paying the dpc bills. mseb owes at least rs <NUM> crore to dpc for december <NUM> and january <NUM>. indeed, dpc made it clear to the godbole committee that nothing was sacred. however, it would negotiate at a common forum which consists of all the three other affected parties mseb, the maharashtra government and the union government. this concern of dpc has already been met. the issue of what is to be renegotiated still remains. the godbole committee itself had laid out the extent of concessions for each of the parties to the deal, and had warned that unless the entire package is agreed upon, this round of negotiations will end like the previous round held in <NUM>. the committee said: ""the renegotiations will be a complete failure and will only end up complicating matters further."" these recommendations are well known and documented now. however, for the record, the godbole panel has recommended splitting the liquefied natural gas (lng) project from the power project. dpc has set up a <NUM> million tonne lng terminal of which only <NUM>.<NUM> million tonne is for the power plant. however the entire cost of the lng facility has been loaded on to the power project. if this recommendation is accepted, it will, first, bring down the cost of the power project. then, it will eliminate the need for mseb to buy about <NUM>.<NUM> million tonne of lng whether it wants it or not. this, in turn, will relieve mseb of an annual burden of $ <NUM> million. the excess lng could be marketed to other players which are mushrooming. the reliance and essar groups as well as petronet lng are keen to set up lng terminals in western india. it has also said that the equity return for the dpc tariff be defined in rupees than in dollar terms. this will insulate the tariff from exchange rate fluctuations. it further adds that this tariff should be benchmarked to the lowest cost of power supply from other gas-based plants in the world. the committee has recommended that the sale of power be allowed to others apart from mseb. this is possible only if the tariff is brought down to rates comparable with other producers. central utilities like the national thermal power corporation (ntpc) and the power trading corporation, besides power companies like bses and tata power, have already made it clear that they are not keen on buying dpc power at the current rates. bses and tata power charge their customers only between rs <NUM> to rs <NUM>.<NUM> per unit. the least cost dpc power works out to rs <NUM> per unit. what happens if the renegotiations fail and enron decides to pull out of the project? will it mean the end of foreign direct investment in a sector which is starved of funds? ""there has been little investment in the power sector over the last decade due to the poor financial health of the state electricity boards. the health of these boards has, in fact, deteriorated over the last decade when reforms have been launched. unless this basic problem is addressed, there will be little investment coming into this sector,"" says r v shahi, cmd of power major bses. this is a point of view that is echoed in the godbole committee report which is otherwise quite critical of dpc. the report warns, ""the committee would like to state strongly that none of the solutions espoused for independent power projects in general and dpc in particular is tenable without the reform of mseb, especially its distribution business."" the day mseb reforms and its finances are in order, bansal and lal will smile more often. india waits for a rediscovery paran balakrishnan <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> business standard <NUM> copyright (c) business standard has india slipped off the world map once again? or, is it about to be re-discovered, now that times are turning tough and inventories are piling up in the international marketplace? six years ago international bankers and corporations couldn't get enough of india. in everyone's mind india was the promised land with a gigantic population that was hungering for everything, from electricity to televisions and black label whisky. foreign investors bought the gdrs of companies like garden vareli and arvind mills that were selling extraordinary growth stories. the world has altered beyond recognition since then. the foreign investors discovered the harsh truth that a gigantic market by itself doesn't always add up to huge sales. many investors burnt their fingers buying gdr issues in companies that soon became terminally ill. the enthusiasm for india ebbed gradually but it returns from time to time. india became the flavour of the season about one year ago when hi-tech fever was at its frenzied peak. suddenly, investors decided that india was logging on to the world and would soon be a good bet once again. businessmen like azim premji were written about in magazines around the world and it was hard not to notice india's hi-tech revolution. plenty has happened since then and it's a safe bet that anyone who invested in the indian stock market one year ago must have lost money if he didn't get out in double-quick time. what about the giant investments that everyone predicted would flow into india? a few years ago, former finance minister p chidambaram told an audience in london that foreign investment in india would easily touch $<NUM> billion by <NUM>. it hasn't even touched half that amount in <NUM> and there's certainly no sign that it is about to pick up sharply. the fact is that brokers, analysts and the global corporations are a bit tired of india. this country is a rickety and rumbunctious democracy and it suffers from a degree of unpredictability that foreigners find baffling. the stock market had just begun to pick up when the tehelka tapes threw it off course once again. the body blow came after bull operator ketan parekh was arrested and accused of manipulating the market. says one london-based broker: ""you never know what to expect. it is just one thing after another."" on another front the signals are getting mixed by the continuing travails of enron and the maharashtra government. as everyone knows the world's power position has changed unimaginably and companies like enron have discovered that there are electricity shortages in places like california. suddenly their enthusiasm for the developing world has waned rapidly. nevertheless, foreign money is still pouring into the stock markets. as the dow jones index and the nasdaq grind to a halt it is clear that there won't be super profits in these markets for several years to come. suddenly, with the index at <NUM>,<NUM> mumbai looks a better bet. the market is almost certainly undervalued and there are definitely bargains to be had. back in the mid-'80s growth in the united states had slowed to a halt and the giant corporations decided that they had to get to europe and south east asia where growth was ticking along at a comfortable pace. come the '90s and the action has shifted back to america. it is extremely likely that the wheel is about to turn once again and this time countries like china and india could be in sharp focus. does it matter what foreign businessmen think about india? the answer is definitely yes. foreign money has changed the balance of power on the bombay stock exchange. and the globe has shrunk with e-mail and swifter jet travel. and with the wto policing the world, india must learn to play by the rules of the game. it must learn to look like a star of the business world and do business like one. enron gets set to pull the plug on power project <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> south china morning post <NUM> (c) copyright <NUM> south china morning post publishers. all rights reserved. a dispute over unpaid debts owed to a united states power conglomerate is casting a cloud over india's foreign investment hopes after a <NUM>-year battle the country's largest direct foreign investor is ready to retreat, but the indians could be the long-term losers. texas-based enron this week took a big step toward abandoning an almost-complete us$<NUM>.<NUM> billion project in india. the board of dabhol power, the indian subsidiary of enron, met in london on wednesday and authorised the company's managing director to issue a preliminary notice to terminate the project, which has been billed as the world's largest natural-gas-fired power plant, the times of india reported. ""the board has given powers to the management to issue the pre-termination notice. but the meeting unanimously felt the need of the hour was not to terminate the project but to initiate a re-negotiation process,"" vinay bansal, chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board (mseb), was quoted as saying by the newspaper. the notice is the first of three steps that could end in the abandonment of the us$<NUM> billion project. a si pune: prayas, the consumer watchdog body on electricity, has told the energy review committee headed by dr madhav godbole that the costly enron power project was not needed to meet the energy requirements of the state and that the very legality and clearances given to the project were questionable. prayas was invited by the godbole committee, which is reviewing the controversial project and other private power projects that are coming up in the state, to make a submission on the enron issue. the non-governmental organisation (ngo) stated that the energy demand of the state was <NUM>,<NUM> million units (mu) in fiscal <NUM>-<NUM> which was expected to go up to <NUM>,<NUM> mu in fiscal <NUM>-<NUM>. possible generation from the existing plants would be <NUM>,<NUM> mu and hence there would be no need to add capacity. the state may suffer a peak-hour shortfall of <NUM> to <NUM>,<NUM> mu which could be mitigated by exploring other options like purchase of captive energy from industrial units, prayas added. the ngo told the committee that the mseb's own generation could be maximised through a series of steps. quality of coal supplied to the mseb's thermal plants could be improved by blending imported coal, thereby generating an additional <NUM> mw. utilisation of uran's idle capacity could yield another <NUM> mw. power could also be procured from tata, bses, captive industrial plants and co-generation by sugar factories. on proposed options regarding enron, prayas stated that the sale of enron power outside maharashtra would not be possible because other states would not afford it. besides, there would be major legal and contractual problems as well, the ngo has said. about other private power projects like bhadrawati, reliance and other liquid fuel-based projects coming up in the state, prayas advised that the government and the mseb should ensure cancellation of all power purchase agreements (ppas). state-wide stir against enron from march <NUM> a staff reporter <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> the times of india copyright (c) <NUM> the times of india; source: world reporter (tm) pune: leftist and socialist parties have planned an intense state-wide agitation from march <NUM> to demand the scrapping of the enron project. addressing a press conference here on tuesday, general secretary of the committee prof ajit abhyankar said over <NUM>,<NUM> demonstrators would group under the banner of the anti-globalisation action committee and stage demonstrations at the enron site in dabhol. ""we will be ready to face any action from the police,"" he said, adding that dharnas would also be held in front of all tehsil offices around the state to coincide with the demonstrations at dabhol. in pune district, demonstrations have been planned at khed, junnar, haveli, purandar, shirur, maval, pimpri-chinchwad and other tehsil offices, prof. abhyankar said. over <NUM>,<NUM> activists are expected to participate in the agitation in the district while a team of <NUM> pune activists will leave for dabhol on wednesday. prof. abhyankar expressed happiness over the fact that not just the leftists parties but also the common people were participating in the anti-enron drive. ""although some constituents of the democratic front government are trying their best to save enron, a strong section in the government is of the opinion that the enron agreement is an insult to the state and the union government,"" he said. without taking names, he hinted that the nationalist congress party (ncp) and the bharatiya janata party (bjp) may forge an alliance to keep enron in the state. speaking on the economic aspects, prof abhyankar said that once the second phase of enron became operational, the mseb would have to cough up rs <NUM>,<NUM> crore annually for buying electricity that the state did not need or could afford. enron, india in dispute over future of gas-fired power plant by ramola talwar badam associated press writer <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> associated press newswires copyright <NUM>. the associated press. all rights reserved. dabhol, india (ap) - workers in yellow helmets scramble up steel girders to fit pipes into place for the world's largest natural gas-fired power plant, to be completed off india's western coast this year by american energy giant enron corp. but <NUM> miles away in bombay, government officials say they cannot afford the electricity that enron is now providing from a naphtha plant at the site, and they expect the electricity generated by liquefied natural gas will cost even more. ""enron is simply unaffordable,"" said padamsinh patil, energy minister for the state of maharashtra, which includes bombay. ""the state cannot afford the power, so we take less power, but still have to pay enron huge amounts."" india needs power - during the april-to-october <NUM> hot season, the nation had a daily shortfall of nearly <NUM>,<NUM> megawatts of electricity, according to the center for monitoring the indian economy. enron's naphtha and gas plants at dabhol will together be able to generate about <NUM>,<NUM> megawatts, but politicians have trouble with the price. aging coal- and gas-fired plants that have been depreciated can charge about two rupees (<NUM> cents) per kilowatt hour, while enron's naphtha plant has been charging <NUM> to <NUM> cents. ""everyone wants to use us to blame for the systemic problem that the state electricity boards in this country sell power for less than it costs them to generate or buy power,"" said k. wade cline, president of enron india. despite the protests, cline believes that the $<NUM> billion project - india's biggest-ever foreign investment - will go on line at the end of <NUM>. an advantage for enron - and the major complaint against it - is a unique contract that requires the federal government to pay up in case of default by maharashtra. another grievance is that the enron deal requires maharashtra to pay for electricity even if it doesn't use it. enron invoked the federal guarantee in february, when the state utility said it could not afford to pay dabhol power corp., houston-based enron's indian subsidiary. but before the national government stepped in, state officials paid $<NUM> million in overdue bills. enron says it is owed $<NUM> million for power delivered in december and january. the february power bill has already been paid, and krishna rao, member of the maharashtra state electricity board, said wednesday the march electricity bill was being paid. the state bailout drew attention to the enron deal, with opponents again raising questions about the cost to be borne for foreign investment and development. the debate comes as the government in new delhi tries to reduce subsidies and sell off state-owned enterprises. enron says federal payment guarantees were essential because few foreign companies were willing to invest when india began opening its economy in the early 1990s. ""who wanted to come to india at that time? very few companies did,"" said cline. ""we came along, with some others, and said we're willing to invest because we think india has a bright future."" preparing for that future, workers at dabhol clamber around inside an lng tank that could fit three jets stacked one atop another. they weld a steel-reinforced dome, while others outside drill concrete blocks for the mile-long jetty where the lng tanker laxmi - meaning ""wealth"" in hindi - is scheduled to dock in november. enron says lng is the cleanest and most economical fuel, but bombay politicians have their doubts. they point at electricity prices that have increased fourfold, which enron attributes to the rise to the jump in oil prices and a depreciation of the indian rupee. opponents of the project say the government should have invested in its own power plant instead of tying up with a foreign company. ""we're not against foreign companies, but the enron project is a sure pill for india's financial collapse,"" said pradyumna kaul, an anti-enron activist. ""it will bankrupt the nation. both sides should agree to a separation and abort the contract now."" enron believes a crackdown on power theft and reduction of waste in transmission and distribution would generate enough money to pay for dabhol's electricity. a state government-appointed committee agreed and this month called for reform of the state power utility that defaulted on its payments to enron. but the five-member panel also insisted on lower tariffs and urged renegotiating the price agreement. enron chief executive jeffrey skilling likened the india situation to the power woes being felt in california. ""the utility offers a fixed rate to their customers and the wholesale costs of electricity have gone up like they have in the u.s.,"" he said from enron headquarters in houston. ""the distribution company is having a liquidity squeeze identical to what you have with (pacific gas & electric)."" meanwhile at dabhol, managers are moving to the next phase, training workers to man tug boats to guide that first lng tanker into port. ""when you first go into these villages with helicopters, bulldozers, they're nervous, as any of us would be,"" said cline. ""but we're in a <NUM>-year partnership here. dabhol is going to be producing power for maharashtra for a long, long time."" end advance for release weekend editions, april <NUM>-<NUM> report on business: net worth stars & dogs a selection of this week's winners and losers compiled by andrew bell <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> the globe and mail metro b10 all material copyright thomson canada limited or its licensors. all rights reserved. *** *** blockbuster bbi in nyse $<NUM>.<NUM> u.s., up $<NUM>.<NUM> (bbi-nyse) top management in huge pointy hats, doublets and hose aren't scared of video-on-demand over the internet. profits are up and, anyway, movies on the web are still a blurry bore. and investors seem pleased to hear a transmission joint venture with stumbling pipeline thing enron has been allowed to suffocate quietly. after all, who wants toxic volatile gas shooting out of the tv? . *** *** fidelity canadian asset allocation business talk & speculation <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> san antonio express-news metro 02c (c) copyright <NUM> san antonio express-news. all rights reserved. alamo city execs don't make the list for the second time in as many weeks, san antonio has been dissed by a national ranking. first it was a progressive policy institute that ranked san antonio 49th in technology out of the top <NUM> metro areas. if that weren't bad enough, a worth magazine ranking of the country's <NUM> best ceos ignores san antonio executives. sure, there's jeffrey skilling of enron in second place. michael dell of dell computer made the list at no. <NUM>. james truchard of austin's national instruments was 28th, while gordon bethune of continental airlines and william wise of el paso energy scored 33rd and 36th, respectively. houston-based spinnaker exploration's ceo, roger jarvis, was ranked 43rd. douglas rock of houston's smith international rounds out the texas contingent at no. <NUM>. no san antonio representation whatsoever, even though the list was compiled based on the executives' ""foresight, judgment and competitive juice to make their investors happy,"" as the magazine said. don't san antonio's oil companies, with their record-breaking earnings, meet that description? enron's stock price gets whipped after broadband unit falls short by brad foss ap business writer <NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM> associated press newswires copyright <NUM>. the associated press. all rights reserved. with natural gas and power prices pumped up, investors have electrified the stocks of the major energy-trading companies over the past year. for enron corp., however, the surge was short-circuited. enron, the nation's top natural gas trader and the leading wholesale electricity marketer, has been punished on wall street for the past seven months. its stock price has fallen more than <NUM> percent since august <NUM>, in large part because of investor pessimism toward the company's nascent high-speed internet unit. just as enron shares were inflated by speculative enthusiasm for enron broadband services inc., they lost considerable gas when investors realized the unit would not be profitable for a couple of years, said jeff skilling, enron's president and chief executive. meanwhile, the stock prices of enron competitors duke energy corp., dynegy inc., reliant energy inc. and el paso corp., seen double-digit percentage growth for the year thanks to volatile natural gas and electricity prices, an essential ingredient for profits in the energy-trading business. enron's success as a buyer and seller of power contracts helped shield its own stock for a while, skilling said, but the weak internet unit left them feeling ""a little bit like a duck in a pond. and there are still a lot of hunters around that pond with a lot of ammo left."" the only way to resuscitate enron's stock price now, skilling said, is to improve earnings. the houston-based company has done just that. its wholesale electricity trading operations fueled a <NUM> percent growth in net profit during the three months ended march <NUM>. but a recent spate of negative news about the company has kept investors jittery. in march, enron's attempt to sell its portland general electric co. unit to reno, nevada-based sierra pacific resources fell apart and its exclusive <NUM>-year video-on-demand partnership with blockbuster inc. was called off. enron also has been dogged lately by difficulties collecting money from customers in india, where a utility has defaulted on nearly $<NUM> million in payments, and in california, where the company's exposure to the bankrupt pacific gas and electric co. is about $<NUM> million. the deflated valuation of enron's stock, however, is most directly linked to its money-losing broadband unit. ""people ascribed a lot of value to (the unit's) business plan,"" said dennis higgins, an energy analyst at morgan stanley dean witter. enron broadband services delivers speedy web services over its nationwide fiber-optic network and sells bandwidth as a commodity to telecommunications firms such as bellsouth corp. and qwest communications international inc. it lost $<NUM> million in the first quarter, but skilling said the wholly-owned subsidiary is ""gaining traction,"" though it would not be profitable for another two or three years. financial analysts now either ignore the internet services division when discussing enron's outlook for <NUM> and early <NUM>, or they go out of their way in research reports to highlight reduced expectations for enron broadband. ronald barone, an energy analyst at ubs warburg, put a positive spin on the ""collapse in broadband valuation,"" in a recent research note. ""the downward revision of some highly aggressive price targets well above $<NUM> were healthy steps in getting this once top performer back on track to delivering solid shareholder returns,"" he said. barone still says enron's stock will reach this level, only it will take <NUM> months instead of <NUM> months. the company's first-quarter profit was $<NUM> million as it swapped electricity and natural gas contracts at a time when low supplies and high demand drove up energy prices nationwide. the stocks of enron's competitors have chugged along since april <NUM>, but enron shares have fallen about <NUM> percent. the williams companies inc., which also invested heavily in telecommunications, has also been a weak performer on wall street compared to its rivals, remaining basically unchanged since a year ago. donato eassey, an energy analyst at merrill lynch, said enron's shares are due for a turnaround, predicting that ""the floodgates are going to open."" at a time when the united states is short on supplies of natural gas and electricity and demand is on the rise, ""few companies are better-suited than enron to help folks deal with those high prices,"" eassey said. as for the once-ballyhooed broadband unit, he said, ""it'll be icing on the cake if it comes back."" --- on the net: <URL> end advance for release weekend editions, april <NUM>-<NUM>",kaggle_enron_emails,0.0,0.0,69752,11294,1.0,0.019339947241656153,0.7753326069503383,0.0003440761555224223,0.036070650303933936,0.04308120197270329,0,14,447,6,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0.2743049406764654,557,20.240143369175627

what is their scope?"" all panel= ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b= y ferc, in strong definitive language. n o one offered any specific langua= ge, but seemed to be urging ferc to issue a formal statement. the next topic was, ""what will be standard market design?"" panelists varie= d on this, but most felt strong guidance from ferc is urgent. some urged f= or one mandatory design for north america, one supported a set of rigid sta= ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (= followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre= nt situation. the commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha= t the industry needed to move forward. they continually visited this topic= throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""do we need to issue = a mega-order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""how much detail do you= need us to provide?"" general feel from the panelsists seemed to be they = wanted strong leadership in this areas. kormos and burkes went so far as t= o say ferc should ""mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a= little further."" others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu= t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t= he need for cautious investigation. =<NUM> one item of interest: wood referred to the filing made by the electronic sc= heduling collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th= e ""rto design and rto implementation"" section would address many of the que= stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to rto design. korm= os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying = a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry. the se= ction to which wood referred was one that i wrote, and asked the following = questions: ? congestion management - when operational security violations occu= r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i= s nonetheless efficient? will lmp based systems be standard, or will there= be others that must be accommodated? ? transmission service - are transmission services required to sch= edule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect= ing from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are a= llowed)?=<NUM> ? loop flows - are contract-path based or flow-based transmission = services appropriate? if contract-path based, how are parallel path issues= to be addressed? ? grandfathered transmission service - should contracts existing pr= ior to rto development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti= re those contracts? are there other solutions? ? energy imbalance markets - how are imbalance markets to function?= will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)= , be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche= dules), or will they be required at all? ? ancillary services - will ancillary service markets be developed = in standard ways? will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary= services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina= ncial instruments (protecting against real-time polr charges)? ? losses - can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? = can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce= ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical= ly unwieldy? ? non-jurisdictionals - how are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate= d into the new world? should systems be designed with the assumption that = non-jurisdictional will be part of an rto? or should they be designed to t= reat each nje as a separate entity? hopefully, ferc will use this section as a template to answer these critica= l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which = to move. kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions= , pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will t= ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""lmp with financi= al hedging instruments"") will take only months. the commission asked mike = about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible = to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed. now for a funny point - one of the commissioners (i think breathitt) refer= red to some concerns expressed in the northwest that their high concentrati= on of hydro power makes lmp inefficient for the northwest. kormos flat out= said, ""my profession is understanding how power systems work, and i don't = believe that that statement is true."" he then backpedaled a bit and said t= hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert= ion by the northwest interests was false. nerc and gisb a great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se= tting organization. massey went so far as to ask, ""are we looking at a bea= uty contest between nerc and gisb?"" cook and boswell then went into severa= l short polite jabs at each other's organizations. other participants cont= inually reiterated the need for one, independent organization. interesting= ly, boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in gi= sb, while cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of nerc and= did not focus on its history. brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of gisb by pointedly a= sking both cook and boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were= they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?). gisb was easily a= ble to say they were not, but nerc of course had to admit to their romancin= g of congress and the bush administration for reliability legislation. poin= t, brownell. mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for nerc, playing dave cook's yes-m= an. he probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to nerc's suppos= ed ""successes,"" such as tlr and e-tag. if staffers have tenure, they will = likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulti= ng in several filings and interventions. we may also wish to file comments= in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show= the pretty picture marty painted was in fact a fiction. there was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues= , but general consensus was that i could not be done. there was also some = talk of folding nerc under gisb/eisb. the arguments began winding down after a some time, and boswell strongly ur= ged the commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade= rship to see whether nerc or gisb should lead the industry forward. nerc s= omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position. in general, i would= say it was a close fight but gisb came out more on top. let me know if you have any questions. andy rodriquez regulatory affairs - enron corp. <EMAIL> <PHONE>=<NUM>",kaggle_enron_emails,0.0,0.0,10587,1667,1.0,0.059412487012373665,0.7025597430811372,0.00018891092849721356,0.06073486351185416,0.08047605553981298,0,32,133,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0.4793041391721656,94,17.54736842105263

""we see <NUM>.<NUM> times book value as an absolute upper bound. there is no way pg&e will get more than that, whatever they think,"" according to the leader of one main consumer groups. ""we are going to try to force any deals down to about <NUM>.<NUM> in any case."" negotiators for davis are also trying to 'proposition-proof' any transmission deal to protect against a later ballot proposal. they think there are ways to do that, but not if the price of pg&e's part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative. remember, if davis's eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative, he will be running for re-election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed to overturn his solution. on the sacramento front - no one understands pg&e's motives the one question no one in sacramento can figure out is what kind of game pg&e is playing. in a three day period pg&e made a series of announcements that left everyone scratching their heads. ? late thursday, pg&e officials leaked information to california papers that they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity transmission grid to the state, which seemed like obvious good news, but then made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least <NUM>% above what the state was currently offering. while a deal can still be done, anything like the $<NUM> billion pg&e wants would be very hard to get through the california legislature which needs to approve any purchase. ? late friday, pg&e officials announced that they had secured a $<NUM> billion loan for the parent company (not the electricity utility) and would use the money to pay off bondholders, other creditors and to return $<NUM> million to shareholders in a new dividend payout. not a cent of that money was earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of pg&e and that left at least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood. ? over the weekend, pg&e leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay off its energy suppliers' debt for <NUM> cents on the dollar right now. for generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will ""make them whole"" in a couple of months, that kind of trial balloon is extremely unnerving. thus, in a very short time period, pg&e's corporate owners showed they could access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the energy crisis. davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at least a part of the $<NUM> billion debt they have accumulated since last summer and pg&e's fund-raising will harden and deepen those demands. as one senior political official told our source ""just when you think the corporate leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible, they come up with something even more outrageous."" pg&e's actions also complicate the broader solution davis is trying to construct to solve california's problems. state democrats doubt they will get republican support for a deal, which means a vote will fall short of the two-thirds majority necessary for immediate enactment (resulting in <NUM> days for the legislation to go into effect). additionally, in the past <NUM> hours, many sacramento sources have reported that forcing creditors to take a less in any debt payback is gaining substantial support with the legislators and may be crafted into any legislation to authorize davis to purchase the electricity grid. long-term contracts - davis didn't tell the whole truth yesterday, davis announced that he had signed ""long-term"" power deals for <NUM>,<NUM> megawatts of power, out of a total <NUM>,<NUM> megawatts he wanted to sign eventually. according to the press release, davis is now <NUM>% of the way toward his long-term goal and has already solved the hardest part of california's energy crisis. this means consumers would maybe pay more than necessary five years from now, but these contracts ""guaranteed"" that consumers would pay less for the next three years. what davis failed to highlight was that of the <NUM>,<NUM> megawatt commitment, actually only <NUM>,<NUM> megawatts are available this summer (when demand is expected to <NUM>,<NUM> megawatts); and some of these ""long-term contracts"" are actually only good for three months. none of these contracts, however, keep california from having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market. davis agrees on new consumer electricity rate hikes for next year while the media was concern with davis's announcement of long term contracts for california, of less concern to the media was davis's quietly announced a decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers. the state will accept the <NUM>% emergency surcharge levied on consumers in january as a permanent increase as well as an additional <NUM>% increase for consumers that will take effect early <NUM> when the old <NUM> rate cut legislation expires. that would bring the average charge to about <NUM> cents a kilowatt hour. ferc the other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the federal energy regulatory commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve it in a positive vote. senior california officials and legislators doubt that ferc has jurisdiction, and believe that ferc would not dare stop a deal. but they may be wrong. ""the deal can only go through if ferc specifically signs off on the deal. its power over transmission deal is absolute, no matter what anyone says,"" according to source close to the president. there are three possibilities: <NUM>) ferc could ""pocket veto"" it by not even putting it on agenda for discussion; <NUM>) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted down. the democrat on the commission, william massey, has already said he is opposed to it; or <NUM>) the commission could approve it but with condition that davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system. one complicating factor in the ferc decision, however, is that its chairman curt hebert, who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale, may not be around long enough to have his say. ""hebert is definitely not a shoo in for the ferc chairman position,"" says one washington official. two other appointments to the commission will soon be named, this official notes, and one of them ""could easily become chairman.""",kaggle_enron_emails,0.0,0.0,11280,1817,1.0,0.017819148936170214,0.776241134751773,0.0001773049645390071,0.03608156028368794,0.04476950354609929,0,9,65,2,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0.40451293340671435,74,24.226666666666667
